The large dark brown bait stations our association has placed around the periphery of our buildings are a constant reminder that the rats which invaded even my own home a few years ago survive in this wooded suburban community.  I've purchased the larger stations and our maintenance people keep them filled, so they are thrilled to have had an opportunity to try this one which is substantially smaller and way more attractive.  I placed this box behind my own building (of course) for our trial purposes and because I'd heard from neighbors in the rear of this building that the rats had been seen.  Since the one person had sealed off the access points which allowed one to enter her home, I figured that would be the perfect spot.When this type of rat bait is used, it's not typical to find a rat coming back for more because they leave the station and then they die.  Another rat comes on over and has a taste and the same happens to him/her.  Since this station supposedly can kill 10 rats, unless you have a serious infestation, you will not see the bait disappear overnight.  There is so much to consider when attempting to rid your home or business of vermin, and I suggest not making a hasty decision.  For example, the last thing you'd want, I'm sure, is to have your victims crawl to and die somewhere inside your walls.  The decomposition is nasty if the source of an odorous situation cannot be located or accessed.  So, seal off access points and then go for the kill.  I like this station and look forward to having it emptied.

I was a bit skeptical at the ability of an electric grill being able to perform as a propane or charcoal grill could but I have eaten my doubt and words.Product arrives in a big box but is actually rather compact; this is because there is no base for the grill to sit on.  That base cart can be purchased as an accessory.  I have always taken issue with the fact that Weber makes you purchase this cart separately.  For a little bit more they should just include it with your original purchase.I wish that we could have used this grill outside but since we have been dealing with the &#34;POLAR VORTEX&#34; for the last month there has never been a warm or dry enough day to sit on the balcony grilling while dreaming of a NY steamy summer.  We opted to grill inside and I will be the first to warn you against doing this UNLESS you have previously done this and understand that there will be a lot of smoke and you will have the smell of street cart vendor stuck to everything on your body!  We set up an air machine, ceiling fan and opened a few windows on this frigid day (21 degrees) and grilled.  There was the mandatory 20 min pre-heat prep for proper searing and temperature regulation.  This wasn't an issue as I took the time to prepare our meal and prep the pork belly and pork chops.The grill heats up quickly and evenly.  I assumed that the metal dome top would steam everything rather than provide a true sear to anything.  I was extremely surprised when all the chops including the pork belly came out beautifully seared and the fat on the pork belly was perfectly charred to our liking.  It was so QUICK!!  Honestly it was quicker than our infrared propane grill on the balcony that we use during the summer.  You have to keep the lid down and this effectively cooks everything quickly and provides the right amount of heat combined with the awesome grates.A tiny issue is that cooking surface is a bit small.  We had to cook everything in 3 batches.  Again, the grill is super quick!  There were two pork bellies and 2 odd shaped chops that would fit at a time.  If you need a better example: Imagine 6 center cut boneless chops; that is what you can grill at one time on the small surface.  Depending on what we are preparing it is not enough space for a family of five.Clean-up is pretty simple and straight-forward.  The grates soak in the sink and then can be wiped clean with your sponge.  You will not need any scouring pads or harsh barbecue brushes.  The bottom bowl located beneath the heating element that catches all the grease/juices is also simple to clean.  Pop out and wash.  This has been the easiest grill we have ever had to clean.Highly recommend for apartment dwellers that are not allowed because of board rules, landlords or city regulations to have a gas or charcoal grill on their patio, balcony or outdoor space.  This item was made for big cities and any New Yorker would love one.  At first I balked at the price thinking that it would be exactly like a George Foreman, but after trying it out I truly believe that it is worth every penny.  I just wish that they would include the cart.  We simply placed it on top of our washer/dryer.  It was smoky but it is even that way when we grill outside on our balcony.  I would also recommend for the consumer that does not want to deal with charcoal or the constant change of propane tanks.  This is as simple as it can get and your family or guests will most likely not be able to tell the difference.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Q140... electric perfection!", "unixReviewTime": 1393372800, "reviewTime": "02 26, 2014"}

Let&#8217;s start with the good:1. It&#8217;s amazingly bright, for a solar-powered system.  Anyone who has installed the old-style solar powered outdoor lights knows that they are bright enough to show people where the lights are, but not exactly useful in providing actual illumination.  The d.light system isn't as bright as an incandescent bulb (or a CF, for that matter), but it does a reasonable job of lighting the area.  And since the cords between the lights and the controllers are long, you can spread them out to light a wider area or mass them to create more intense light.2. The lights are individually controlled and each one has a high power/low power option, so you can decide for yourself how to choose between brightness and the length of time your system will function without a recharge.3. The system is advertised as providing light for a long time.  One light on low power operates for 15 hours.  Operating both lights high power, the system operates for 3.5 hours.  But even that is a pretty long time if, for instance you are lighting a cabin, tent or garden shed.  Also, the lights glowed brightly even with just a couple of hours of sun.4. It is simple to install; all you need is a drill and screwdriver to install the 10 screws.  The instructions consist of three pictures and about that many some self-evident sentences. But that&#8217;s all you need.The flaws are minor, but  worth mentioning:1. It&#8217;s fairly pricey.  At $185, this system is worthwhile only if it&#8217;s going to last a while. Otherwise, you are better off hanging an LED-powered flashlight with rechargeable batteries from the ceiling. The system is guaranteed for two years, but since this is a new product, there&#8217;s no telling how long it will actually last.2. There is no mounting hardware. One would think that it would not be too difficult for the manufacturer to add the include screws to fasten the solar panel, the four screws to attach the two controllers and the two screws for the lights. It also wouldn't be too difficult to include cable staples to hold the wires in place, which are conveniently pictured in the instructions but inconveniently not included in the package.

Most project a stream of spray anywhere from 10 to 20 feet away from the nest.  I usually use Raid or Spectracide.  I don&#8217;t think any of the sprays reach their claimed distance.  Spectracide claims 22 feet.  The best I ever achieved was about 15 feet.  I am sure it varies in their controlled tests and from can to can, climate, etc.  For my use, which is typically near my deck or house or in my yard, 15 feet is plenty.This brand, Terro, claims to be able to be applied from 20 feet away.  I have used it at about 6-8 feet, and as much as 15 feet.  Beyond that I don&#8217;t think it reaches, and loses accuracy (hits a wider area than the intended target).It appears to be just as effective as the other brands.  I do think this is a better &#8220;day time&#8221; spray.  Most sprays tell you to use it in early evening, after wasps have returned to the nest.  Sometimes there are a lot of wasps about and you want to use your deck or areas right outside your home though, so you may find the need to use a spray in the daytime.  This spray forms a foam over its target, so it traps wasps, while also killing those who try to escape.As far as effectiveness on contact, I have found that Raid will usually result in an immediate kill, with many wasps falling out of the air as the spray touches them.  With Terro, it seems a few who made it through the foam died soon after, but maybe hung on for a few seconds, more so than with Raid or Spectracide.While the encapsulating foam is a great way to instantly &#8220;lock down&#8221; the nest and destroy its inhabitants, like any other spray, it does leave you with some clean up afterward.  Nothing that you can&#8217;t hose away afterward.  Depending on how heavy you apply it (it doesn&#8217;t take much to kill the wasps), you have a white foamy clump for 5 to 15 minutes.Terro says this product may be used indoors.  I would avoid using any spray of this type indoors.I have used it on my deck (pressure-treated wood) and against my house, near mortar and my vinyl siding (a tan &#8220;Cedar Impressions&#8221; shake style vinyl).  It doesn&#8217;t appear to stain.  It leaves some residue until it is hosed away.I would recommend this product.

Assembly took me less than five minutes to put together came with 3 bolts and one wrench. The packaging was very well put together, as well. The instructions were very simple and easy to follow, which only took three steps, attached the three legs to the bowl with the sturdy bolts. The legs attach very easily and feel very stout.  The legs of the fire pit hold up the bowl. The log grate isn&#8217;t built in like many other fire pits, instead it sits in the middle of the bowl. This makes it easier to remove and clean. The log grate is extremely important; its function is to improve the airflow. The bowl is a bit shallow, but is able to handle 3-4 logs without trouble.The stainless steel legs are a really nice touch; it gives the fit pit a modernized look. The bowl is very big and roomy; I didn&#8217;t think so at fist when I saw the image. When the top cover is on it stands up to an adults thighs. The cover makes it really safe so children do not get to close to the fire. An ideal location for this pit would be in the lawn or patio area, it really catches the eye and entertains guests. The pit is very durable and can be used for many years as long as it&#8217;s well kept. It did come with a cover, which I felt was not good in quality, but as long as it keeps the rain out I&#8217;m happy. The pit itself is very light weight 30 pounds, which makes it easy to travel with and move around. I don&#8217;t see why a person could not take this on a camping/out door trip, the legs attach and detach quite easy. It would have been nice if it came with a grate for grilling, because there is enough space between the log grate and the top of the pit.Overall all I am pleased about the value of this fire pit and its functionality.

I haven't taken stars off for this, because my neighbors little gas powered beast does the EXACT same thing, so I see this as not being an issue - if  you want better power, spend more and get a higher powered device!The reason I pulled back one star is while I really like the size, power, etc., I'm slightly disappointed in the build quality - the chute that directs the snow comes in two pieces and is held together with a VERY small bolt, washer, and nut. I am happy this comes with a 4-year warranty, though, but really would have liked to see this built with a bit more heft so I wouldn't be concerned about it possibly breaking in the future during use.Bottom line: REALLY good power, slightly cheaply made, but ran really nicely and throws snow further than some gas powered equivalents!", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great power, slightly concerned about possibly cheap design.", "unixReviewTime": 1391904000, "reviewTime": "02 9, 2014"}

You could, kind of, roast on the heat coming through the grate, but we lost two marshmallows on it that way and it was pretty messy (melted marshmallow remains today), so I wouldn't recommend.Of course, be sure you're using the pit on a stable, fireproof surface (concrete or stone recommended) as putting this on your lawn is just asking for trouble ...

These mats are not suitable for conventional outdoor grilling, where high heat and licks of flame are part of the process. These mats are suitable to use in place of parchment paper on your cookie sheets.I grill because I want to create nice crusty sear marks on my foods, whether it be steaks, burgers, kabobs, veggies, seafood or fish. Even when I need to cook foods at a lower-than-high temperature, I still start out by searing the outside. Why bother grilling if that is not the result you are looking for?When I grill over fire (wood or charcoal), even when I try to prevent flare-ups, they happen. And when I crank up the Weber gas grill, it heats to well-over 500 degrees before I toss on the food. Same with my Char Broil infrared grill.The mats are basically like a Silpat mat.Mats are NOT suitable for live fire grilling: Why? Because you can NOT allow flame to touch them.Mats are NOT suitable for searing: Why? Because you can NOT allow temperature to go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.With these mats, you will definitely prevent your grill grates from getting messy, but you will never be able to create a Maillard Effect (caramelization), because you will never be able to get the mats hot enough to create a sear. And, if you've used a marinade, and if your food becomes juicy, the liquid will run off the mat because there is no lip....Hmmmm.....So you will still get flare-ups and you will still get your grates messy.ABOUT THE SKEWERS: They, also, are limited in use: The tips are rounded, not pointy and sharp for easy piercing. These rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies. Forget trying to skewer tomatoes, onion rings, peppers or shrimp. Take a close look at the middle picture, you can see how rounded the tips are. Also, notice that the tips are a bigger diameter than the rest of the skewer. What that means is this: You thread the food over the tips and create a big hole. Then you slide it onto the very pliable thinner cable. Your food will definitely NOT hold in place. It swings around and flops around on the narrow cable, because it started out by going through a big hole.And I'm not sure how this replaces aluminum foil or how it can be used effectively for roasting: Foil wraps any way you want it to, and it can keep fluids contained so you don't lose the juices and so you don't dirty a pan. These mats are flat and will always be flat and fluid will run right off of it.All around this is a very bad idea for the grill.*I received a sample product from TeiKis for review, and I'm not a wimp and not afraid to hand out one-star reviews when they are warranted.

This feeder after being up for a week does not leak. They have addressed the other issues, but it will be awhile in Wisconsin before these other issues are tested. The area where the bird gets the juice has a raised end point to keep the wasps from getting the juice. The top of the feeder has a reservoir which can be filled with water to keep the ants from crossing over to the feeder from the hanger. I have not yet been able to test these, but they do seem like good ideas.One problem that I can foresee is that the water will evaporate quickly and will require attention. The container for the provided nectar fills the feeder about half way. Generally we just use sugar and water which is boiled to purify.

The two warm spring days in the Chicagoland area we have had thus far were spent teaching one of the kids to ride their bike and not cleaning cars.  Regardless, I rolled out the hose on a rather chilly spring day and gave it a shot.The temperature when I used the hose was 48F.  Why am I mentioning this?  The directions on the hose recommend setting the hose up when it is above 70F.  Despite being well below the recommended temperature, the hose did indeed lay flat on the ground as advertised.  Despite being left out overnight in around freezing temperatures and being only around 50F when I used it, the hose remained soft and pliable in the cool weather, even after running cold water through it.  It remained easy to coil up by hand while my other &#8220;good&#8221; hose was stiff and would only easily make large loops when I tried to coil it up by hand.Walking around the yard, I personally did not experience any kinks in the hose nor did I see any portion of the hose threatening to kink if I pulled it tight.  It remained fairly flat to the ground and did not bunch up.I thought the connectors to the hose were excellent.  Prior to obtaining this hose, I had no idea that the quality of hose connectors varied.  The female end of the hose is large and textured.  This makes it easy to grab and the design of the connector makes it incredibly easy to thread the fitting on the spigot.  I did not have to fight with the fitting to get it threaded on the spigot like I did with my other hoses.  The male end is just as easy.  The hose attachment threads right onto the hose fitting.The only drawback I had with this hose was the female fitting.  I ensured the washer was in place and that it was seated into the female fitting, but the connection still leaked.  I tried it on several different spigots and attaching it to the male end of another hose but the hose still leaked at the female fitting.  In all due fairness this hose leaked a lot less than my other hoses when I tried those.  Perhaps this is being caused by the cold shrinking the rubber washer.  For now, I am deducting a star for that reason.  If it works better when it gets above 70F, I will adjust my rating accordingly.If someone had told me that it was a worthwhile investment to spend around $1 per foot on a garden hose, I would have thought they were out of their mind.  I would have said that my 100 foot hose I got from a warehouse store for $30 works just fine.  However, after trying a quality hose like this one, I will be replacing my cheap hoses as soon as funds allow.  I highly recommend this hose!

Could have been the super long and miserable winter, but I could not WAIT to get this set up. Luckily, setup was a breeze and required no tools whatsoever. Screw about six things in by hand, loop the hammock over the hooks and you're in business. In less than ten minutes, I was enjoying my first hammock ever!Some others mentioned an odor/smell, but I didn't notice anything. I set this up outdoors in about 70 degree weather and didn't notice anything and I'm highly sensitive to smells, esp that new plastic/manufacturing smell.I didn't have any struggles putting the pieces together, either. It was so easy to put together and I truly did appreciate not having to use any tools to screw anything into place.I logged about two hours in the 'mock today and I have to tell you, there's no uncomfortable position. I initially was a little skeptical that I'd like a hammock that was so wide (seeing the hammock 'burrito' pictures some others posted left me curious), but I've found that the wideness can sometimes provide some shade, too. There are so many ways to lie on this and it's just so cozy. I opted for the cotton hammock (color: tropical), and not the sunbrella fabric. The cotton is super soft and durable.I will take the cotton hammock part in the garage when not in use, but will leave the stand in the yard all summer.The hammock and stand seem very well-made. I had no hesitation about moving around in it and getting in and out. This hammock can accommodate up to 450 lbs. I had my boyfriend join me in the hammock, but it was kind-of cramped and, as he said, \"it's not my thing\". Pffft - more hammock for me!The hammock and stand come with a carrying case, too.

But I have also become increasingly disabled so have been trying some more compact grills. I ordered this since like so many have stated, it LOOKS very APPLE like.Looks verses performance....Being so disabled I had 2 neighbors assemble it for me and as a reward, be the first to cook on it with MY food. The box is in itself like a little puzzle you follow to assemble the grill. It's really funny watching neighbors argue about assembly when drinking a few beers with such an odd cut along the dotted lines layout:-)It took maybe 30 minutes of actual assembly time using MY tools. Add another 15 minutes for USMC opinion sharing that wasn't needed but free entertainment for me anyway. On a side note, I wish Vendors would allow me to choose WHO delivers my parcels....Especially given what my driver has told me about the FUN they have seeing who can toss what the HARDEST off of walls etc......Given the ripped, torn, slashed parcels I have received from UPS I have NO respect for them and would elect to even pay a premium for FEDEX or USPS. Luckily, the contents here were &#8220;OK&#8221; and all worked fine.We had very quick and EVEN cooking/heat. We only elected to cook 6 hamburgers since Marines I know anyway are happy as can be with just good old beer & burgers. Meat was juicy as any other grill I have owned as long as I do NOT flip them constantly. I cook 4 minute on Medium, flip for another 3-4 minutes and EAT the suckers.I LOVE the look and functional design. I am still getting used to using the lid design but I am so disabled I have odd problems with even the most simple things. I like the locking wheels though I can't imagine my wheelchair going fast enough with a lap full food to add to the grill that I could really have much NEED for them?To be honest, it is simply the BEAUTY of this that attracts me to it so much. I give it 4 stars and if nothing fails or no weak links appear, I will raise it to 5 stars. I will also have to buy another LPG cylinder if I keep using this over my other since I am unable to swap out my single tank between my grills and this does NOT come with one of it's own....No big deal, just be aware you do NOT get one included.. The one negative for me and it is sort of a BIG one since I am so disabled is this has no fold up/down side trays of any type.

It offers decent homeowner-grade performance with the benefit of being attachment capable. Not heavy-duty enough for extensive use, and the bump head is very finicky.Full review: It&#8217;s getting tough to find something that isn't made by MTD these days. That&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing since they make some decent gear considering the price. (They also make some really poor stuff as well.)This is one of their decent efforts. The main issue with the Remington, much like everything made by MTD, is that it&#8217;s intended for light-duty use. It&#8217;s perfectly fine for they typical suburban yard, but if you have a couple of acres to deal with, need something for commercial use, or want something that will last for a couple of decades, look elsewhere (I&#8217;d suggest brands such as Stihl or Echo. A lot more money, but a lot more durable as well).Starting/running &#8211; fired up pretty quickly right out of the box. It comes with oil and uses a 40:1 ratio (again, typical of most MTD devices). I did have to adjust the idle so it would run smoothly at low RPMs, which is easy to do (outlined clearly in the manual). It has a spring loaded pull rope which I really like. I have that on my Troy-Bilt machines, and it&#8217;s a great feature for folks like me with back problems. Rather than have to do a sharp tug to get it started, you pull the rope in a smooth motion. There&#8217;s a spring that compresses when you pull, and then releases. It&#8217;s hard to explain but easy to use and a great feature for ease of starting. The downside is that when the spring breaks, it&#8217;s a major, major pain to fix.Power &#8211; This has a decent amount of power (25cc 2-cycle engine) for getting through tough weeds, provided you use good quality line. Although this is attachment-capable, it does not have enough power to effectively run things such as a tiller attachment. It&#8217;s fine for most other attachments.Attachments &#8211; This has the typical split boom setup and will take attachments made by MTD (and their related brands such as Craftsman). I tried it with attachments from Troy-Bilt and Craftsman (an edger and a straight shaft trimmer head) without any problems.Weight/Balance &#8211; Decent on both. The vibration was not too bad &#8211; on a par with others in this price range. The grip handle is hard plastic but reasonably comfortable.Controls &#8211; straightforward. The build quality on some, such as the choke lever, is not great, so some care is needed to ensure it does not break. I like that the on/off switch is on the shaft near the handle so it&#8217;s easy to get to.Bump head &#8211; horrible! I didn't have much faith that it would work well since every other MTD bump head I've tried has been poor. This was no exception &#8211; feeding is sporadic and the force needed to feed out line puts way too much stress on the drive shaft (e.g., you&#8217;ll end up cracking it when bumping the line). If you get this, toss the bump head and get a fixed line head. You can pick one up at a home center store for just a few bucks. Yes, you&#8217;ll need to manually put the line in, but it&#8217;s very simple and far more reliable than the bump feed. Plus, you can use better quality line, such as Gatorline, which cuts through weeds much better than the standard stuff.Tip: MTD machines hate ethanol in gas &#8211; it will kill the fuel lines. I add both Sta-Bil and Sea Foam to my gas, and that has worked great. Zero problems with fuel lines, and all my 2-cycle machines have started and run well over the years.This is a decent choice for light-duty use. It&#8217;s not one of those tools that you&#8217;ll be able to hand down to the grand kids, but it will get the job done for several years (provided that you maintain it and use additives in the gas). The split shaft allows you to use this for multiple jobs, such as edging, or replace the curved shaft with a straight shaft. In comparison to a Stihl or Echo it&#8217;s quite poor, but, for the price charged, it&#8217;s a pretty decent choice. 5 stars since it delivers a good level of performance for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A decent value in an MTD-brand trimmer", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}

This Tomcat Rat Snap Trap is super easy and safe to set.  Use hand or foot to depress the set pedal down until it clicks.  Bait is inserted via the bottom using the removable bait cup.  You never have to put your digits in the kill zone.2. With the old-fashioned wooden type trap, there is the possibility of the rat approaching the bait from the reverse side of the trap.  This can cause the rat to be tossed clear and result in a \"non-catch\".  You can bet the sly rodent will now be trap-shy.  With the Tomcat, the rat can only approach from the \"business-end\" of the trap (front or sides), resulting in a reliable catch/kill.  In the case of a capture but non-kill, the Tomcat's interlocking teeth are more effective that the old smooth metal bar at preventing withdrawal and escape.A well thought-out and effective trap.

I would have liked it to be a little longer since I just feel as if there's a better, more secure connection that way. If you leave the included washer in on the incoming connection, the length to connect shortens to about 1/4 inch. I used teflon tape where I could, and have had no issues with leaking around the connections.The faucet points more horizontal than vertical so if you add connections (I attached a 4-way manifold), it juts out, I would estimate, about 70 degrees from the stake. Besides being unsightly, the water shoots out from my manifold mostly horizontally instead of down. It makes it difficult if you're just trying to drop water down from the faucet into a bucket or watering can. With a little testing, you can learn to open the faucet just enough with a low enough flow the water will flow mostly down, hold the bucket up next to the faucet, or just figure out where to place your bucket on the ground wherever the water ends up falling. More guesswork than I would like to bother with.This bib extender works for the basic need of placing a faucet in another location.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Basic needs", "unixReviewTime": 1400976000, "reviewTime": "05 25, 2014"}

Granted, it helps novice gardeners from making mistakes such as using a high nitrogen fertilizer on something such as tomatoes, but it also is somewhat unnecessary provided you read the formulation.This is a 10-7-7 fertilizer. The first number refers to nitrogen (helps with greening and foliage growth); the second is for phosphorus (promotes root growth); the third is for potassium (helps strengthen plant cells). It&#8217;s a good formulation for pansies but also can be used for other flowering plants.It also includes small amounts of sulfur (improves uptake of nutrients), iron (aids in plant health and improves the green color) and manganese (helps with iron absorption). All in all, a generally decent fertilizer formulation.The granules are small but not too powdery, and are uniform in size. It&#8217;s easy to spread and work into the soil. Watering after application is recommended and, given the high N content, you should take care not to get this on foliage (or wash it off if you do) to prevent burning.The cons are the cost &#8211; this is very pricey per pound, and there&#8217;s nothing special about the formulation to justify the cost. The other con is that only one-third of the nitrogen is from water insoluble sources (which for this fertilizer is feather meal, bone meal and meat meal). Water insoluble sources are important to prevent fertilizer run-off into streams and other water bodies, where it promotes algae blooms. While water soluble nitrogen works faster and gives you that quick &#8220;pop&#8221; of growth and color, it is not ideal due to run off.I&#8217;ll give this 3 stars.

To be honest, I haven't seen much of a visible effect after nearly three weeks except for the large spot where I used the weed and feed fertilizer. So it is very likely a cumulative effect of this 10-0-6 fertilizer and the 29-0-10 weed and feed fertilizer that led to the very green grass area.The first number is the amount of available nitrogen, the second number is phosphate and the third number is potash. High nitrogen makes for fast green growth, but not necessarily good plant health.  The potash ingredient is there for overall plant health.

It is all designed to be highly water soluble to get into the soil - or be washed away into the street gutter and into the groundwater supply.Part of my test result was tainted by the prior high nitrogen weed and feed fertilizer application. But it does illustrate the short term effect of nitrogen for a fast growing green yard (but not necessarily a long term healthy yard).

So with that said, I've used this for painting interior walls, using thick, not-thinned, latex paint.  And for me, it did much better than expected.The paint went on with very even coverage as long as you just sweep the sprayer back and forth.  As opposed to hand painting, the amount of paint used versus the amount of paint needed is significant - I used maybe half of what I had used prior with a paintbrush.  Granted, the coat of paint is much thinner, but that's also a good thing - it dried much faster, and if needed, I can apply another coat.  (So far, I don't see any reason to apply another coat.)The setup of this was easy - just add some paint, screw on the sprayer you want to use (small one for detailing jobs, big one for big jobs), and have at it.  You can change the amount of paint being sprayed as well as the force that the turbine blows the paint out (which, for latex paint, needs to stay at one of the more powerful settings.)All in all, this is a great painting system, and for the admittedly limited number of painting projects I've been able to use it on so far, I'd recommend it highly.

My favorite part is pressing a button to turn it on, just like a blender.

But it is definitely more than powerful enough for regular lawn mowing and I would never call it underpowered. I always use the mulching mode and it looks as though the grass clippings have disappeared.The first time I mowed with the cord, I wondered if I had made a mistake. There is a trick to it. Cut your yard in half from the point where the cord plugs in. Begin at that center point and mow line by line outward away from it until you have mowed that entire half of the lawn. Then, return to the center point and begin line by line on the other half. In this way, the cord is always behind you.

The description mentions &#34;Get up to 70 minutes of run time with the G-MAX 40-volt high-capacity 4 Ah and low capacity 2 Ah Li-Ion Batteries (included with purchase)&#34; which I didn't take as it includes one of each capacity battery. You get one of each which I was not exactly happy about. Additionally, extra 4 AHr batteries cost $149.99 list.On to the real stuff.I started looking at this when considering the various cordless electric mowers that are available. I like it better than the lead-acid battery based cordless mowers due to the size and weight of the batteries and the maintenance required for them. Our gas powered mower was getting annoying with starter cord breaks, oil and gas maintenance, and the self-propelled portion was starting to wear out. It was important to me to go green and make things simpler than gas powered.ProsOut of the box, this was so easy to set up. There was even a slight charge on the batteries to try it out (still, fully charge before use). It said &#34;team lift&#34; on the box but it wasn't that heavy. No tools were need to get this prepped for action.The first thing I noticed was the &#34;push the button, pull a lever and mow&#34; simplicity. There was no priming, no pulling the a starter, possibly multiple times, and no flooding. It just turned on and I was ready to go.Next thing I noticed was how light it really is. Coming off the weight of a heavy, self-propelled (weakly), all metal mower going to this largely plastic one was a gift. I didn't even notice it wasn't self-propelled. My initial thought was that it could easily have been built by Fisher-Price since it reminded me of my son's toy from so many years ago. Pushing it around is very easy.This thing is super quiet. Even more fun, it sounds like a bumblebee compared to the gas powered monstrosity I had previously. I even had a neighbor approach me after a mowing once with concerns that I was &#34;losing it&#34; thinking that, with my headphones on, I was pushing around a mower that wasn't running. I confirmed my sanity and explained the battery powered mower really does save your hearing.ConsI saw several references to uneven cuts and I would have to agree. Although some speculate that it is because the blades don't overlap, I think it is because of the mostly solid bottom of the deck. Most unevenness I found has been when dealing with dandelions that are so much longer than the rest of the grass. They tend to be missed if off to the side or dead center. There will also be some missed blades of grass on each pass, but I'm not meticulous about my lawn so it isn't an issue.There are quirks, too. I had the mower quit twice when it transitioned between batteries (the control circuitry uses one battery then switches when it runs out). Granted, it was early on and since then, I have only had it slow some, then kick in with the second battery.I also noticed that it adjusts the blade speed when the grass gets thicker. This is a great idea to maintain an even cut, except there is a time lag when you hit a change in the lawn. I have started working the system so that when I hit thicker lawn, I slow a little while the motor controller spools up the rpm's to handle the load. Minor issue, but the alternative is to have a machine that is psychic.The amount of time off full charge is a little less than advertised. It could be a smooth, even lawn that it was tested on so my irregular lawn might be what cuts the time down. I don't have a huge lawn, but it takes multiple sessions to mow it. Inconvenient, but I also don't get tired. If the weather cooperates, I get it done all in one day. Other times, it takes a couple.Overall, I am quite happy with this mower. I wish it had (2) 4 AHr  batteries instead of (1) 4 AHr and (1) 2 AHr. I also wish the motor controller was more responsive to changes in lawn resistance and better at the transition between batteries.None of this would prevent me from buying it again.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great, lightweight mower for city lawns.

I saw these cubes and not realizing they were as small as they are, decided to order them too because they are pretty well priced and I figured having a variety of traps would be good.Well, I set my chipmunk trap and the next morning the bait was gone and the trap wasn't sprung. Although these traps seem like they would be too small for a chipmunk, I decided to put one with bait inside the chipmunk trap, hoping maybe he would work to get the bait and spring the trap.Well, to my surprise, I checked the trap a while later and there was a mouse in it! I didn't even know I had mice! So took the little bugger out to a distance field and released him and then set all 4 of the traps. A few hours later, they were all full again.They work wonderfully, but I appear to have a larger mouse infestation that I am thankful to have discovered. I just ordered a multiple catch trap as well as 2 more packs of these so I can get rid of more at a time.About the traps: I use a small piece of cracker smeared with just a tiny bit of peanut butter in each trap. The traps have a flap door which I believe allow for sufficient ventilation. The traps must be checked each day or the mouse could expire, without access to food and water.Some people have questioned why teh traps dont have holes in the solid plastic for ventilation. I am personally glad they don't have holes because the mice produce a disgusting amount of urine and feces, which can spread diseases to humans.

It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and &#34;upgraded&#34; to the MM1800, the 18&#34; corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn't feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick.I decided to try to leave the Black and Decker world and see what else I could find.Bear in mind, I did not consider gas because I don't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I did not want cordless battery power because I didn't want to have to keep batteries alive (some require charge/discharge cycles all winter) or buy new batteries.Corded lawn mowers are a fine solution. Many complain about &#34;cord management&#34;, but here's the trick. Your lawn never changes. Unless you are a professional landscaper (and if you are, buy a gas mower), then you always mow the same lawn. So the trick is to come up with a mowing pattern where you mow away from the outlet and never trip over the cord. Once you have a pattern, stick with it and you can mow quickly.I finally discovered the Greenworks 25022 20&#34; electric bag/mulch/side discharge mower. You can read my review there of that amazing lawn mower.  Since I have used the Greenworks for the past 3 years, I can only review Sun Joe by comparing it.The first thing I noticed about the SunJoe mower is that it was  far lighter than the Greenworks.  At 33lbs, it is exactly 23 lbs lighter and you can easily notice that as you move it around.  The SunJoe is really easy to transport around the yard and push on a steep hill.  It also has very large tires which makes it easy to push.  Unfortunately the tire tread is not rubber but rather hard plastic, so they aren&#8217;t the best tires in the world, but at least the size makes the mower relatively easy to maneuver.The mower was easy to assemble &#8211; just attached 4 hand-tightened bolts to assemble the handle and you are done.  The handle is a standard &#34;push the button and pull the safety bar&#34; handle.  The mower plugs in with a pig-tail cable, a very secure way of handling the power.  The mower is set by default to mulch, but there is a bag you can use.  The bag was a bit of a let down &#8211; there is a snap-in handle which just loved to unsnap as I used it.  There is also no side-discharge option like the Greenworks has - you can only mulch or bag.The mower also has an easy one-handle height adjust which made changing cutting heights very simple.In terms of performance, I found the mower did a decent job, but was significantly louder than any other electric mower I have tried.  This may be due to the all-plastic body construction.  I mowed my lawn while dry but a bit long and found that the mower did bog down on some of the heavier grass.  Trying an uncut patch nearby, I found my old Greenworks cut right through it.Overall, this mower gets a strong 4 stars.  It is lightweight, easy to use, and does a nice job on grass that isn&#8217;t too long.  My Greenworks mower still gets my vote due to the all-metal deck, the rubberized tires, the quieter operation, and more powerful motor.  But the light weight of the SunJoe will be less intimidating to many buyers, so I can definitely recommend it if weight is a concern..", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "There are better electric mowers, but this one shines in its light weight design", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014"}

I have corded and cordless lawnmowers, trimmers, edgers, blowers, etc, from major brands such as Black and Decker and Greenworks.  I regularly mow my lawn with a Greenworks 25022 lawn mower and trim it with a Black and Decker plug-in string trimmer.  I have never owned a Remington trimmer, but I thought I would give it a try.On removal from the box, I was impressed at the ease of assembly.  No need to break out a screwdriver - the nylon cutting line is pre-wound and installed, and the plastic guard snaps on with ease.  The handle is tightened down with a simple knob.  As I picked up the trimmer and went outside to try it, I noticed the first strike against the trimmer.  It is heavy.  At 9 lbs, it is literally 2x the weight of the comparable corded string trimmers from Black and Decker.  Unlike some tools, extra weight does NOT help with a string trimmer.  It makes it a pain to use.I plugged in the trimmer which was easy thanks to the plug pig-tail, a nice feature over the plug moulded-into-plastic which B&D; uses.  The pig-tail means you can get a good attachment to a cord and it is less likely to fall out.  I trimmed my grass with ease, and then flipped it over to try some edging.  Once again, the 9# of weight make this a bit awkward, but I persevered.  There is a nice wheel on the front for making this easier - my B&D; has no such wheel, but then again, it is lighter so the wheel is less necessary.Of course, edging against a sidewalk will wear down the line, and I quickly found myself with a shorter and shorter line.  Unfortunately, the sophisticated &#34;auto-feed&#34; system did absolutely nothing.  I flipped over trimmer, tried my best to manually feed some line (not easy when it's an auto-feeder&#34;), but when it ran short again, it still refused to feed more line.It's not really for me to debug - every other trimmer I have owned just works.

These claws are the best thing to come along for that task than anything I can remember.When I was offered a review sample I thought they were cast iron - it turns out they are nylon, but are as strong as any metal utensils I have used. They are relatively light, rigid, but with a little give, and the pair of them can easily withstand the weight of a ten pound piece of meat (the largest size I tried lifting with them.)While these are excellent for lifting and transporting meat, they were designed to shred it and that they do. Once you get the hang of using them - a very slight learning curve - you can shred meat like a hungry raptor. There is sufficient room between the handle portion and the claws to keep you from burning or scalding your knuckles as long as you hold them perpendicular to the meat while you are working on it. Coming at a large piece of meat from a lesser angle can blister your knuckles. Also, the claws are pretty sharp and require the same level of respect as a razor sharp knife. But if you exercise caution and common sense these are completely safe.Although they are of nylon they will not easily melt. They can withstand 450 degrees F, so they are dishwasher safe. I will caution you to thoroughly clean them with a strong jet of water on the back side because there are channels behind the claws that can collect meat. Even if you machine wash them, take care to remove meat from that part of the claws because that is a weak point from a sanitary perspective. Again, common sense and diligent attention to sanitation will prevent problems.I tried these out the same day they arrived and am impressed.

All in all assembly took only around thirty minutes and I didn't use nearly as many bad words as I've used with other products.Once it was together, this pressure washer was very easy to operate: plug it in, press the button, connect and turn on the hose and turn on the washer. You can use the adjustable sprayer for focused or low power washing, or you can use the rotating head for a powerful, clean \"sweeping\" action. Both heads worked great and having the adjustable flow was very useful when I used it to wash my car.

Kid (not pet) safe, and indoors only.Mouse Killer III: Refillable. Kid (not pet) safe, and indoor only.Of the four, Mouse Killer I makes the most sense to me. It's as safe as they get, and refillable (and therefore more cost-effective in the long run). They all come with the same poison, so there's no difference there. This one has an additional covering over the entrance the others don't have, making it a little more tamper resistant, and a bit more attractive to mice, which like such things.The disadvantage of poisons? They don't work right away, and the rodents may go off and die in a place where you can't get to them, but their rotting corpses still stink up your house.My preferred option is stillsnap traps, which are infinitely reusable without purchasing additional products (poisons, etc), and much cheaper, especially when obtained at a local hardware store.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not the one I'd choose.

I did have a bit of problem mastering the technique of paint spraying, and I don't think I fully have it yet, but I'm sure that will come in time. I tended to want to hold the sprayer a bit closer to the surface of the object I was spraying (in this case some shutters and trim on the outside of my garage) than was advised in the instructions, which resulted in the paint being sprayed a bit more thickly than I wanted. Again, that's my fault and not the sprayer. The instructions, as I said were very clear as to how to use the sprayer. Also, even though I was warned by a few people that there would be a lot of overspray, I didn't mask the non-painted areas off as well as I probably should have. The Flexio is pretty accurate as far as where the paint goes, but there is still a fair amount of overspray, so I will be more careful next time.Cleanup was easy, although there are a lot of little parts that need to be disassembled. Again, great instructions from Wagner, so I wasn't afraid to completely break the Flexio down to clean it. I was happy that Wagner also included a small brush to use to help clean away all the paint from the unit. Once it was disassembled and flushed/brushed out, the whole unit came away very clean, and it was easy to put it back together again.As a novice to paint sprayers, I was very pleased with the Flexio 590, and I can honestly say that it is a great product, and easy to operate, even for someone with little to no experience.

It has never hurt any of my flowers.  My mini-roses are in the same beds and they like it every bit as much as the larger roses do- just watch that you don't over apply it - there's a picture on the jug showing how it should look on the ground if applied right - it's a great guide and easy to compare just with sight.

The hummingbirds don't seem to care as long as there's fresh nectar (sugar water).This 48 ounce feeder is BIG. Unless the hummingbirds we get would consume 48 ounces within a couple of days, this size is overkill. That's because when the daily temperature hits the 90's, a couple of days is the most we can go before replacing the nectar and cleaning the feeders.I don't know about the store bought nectar because we make our own (3 parts boiling water to 1 part sugar), but it can go cloudy in as quick as a day during the hottest part of summer. Cloudy is bad, as are visible black floating specks. It means contamination.As long as the nectar doesn't get contaminated, cleaning is pretty easy, it's really just a matter of rinsing. However, once there's contamination, a full out washing is the only way to feel it's safe to use again.For me, the best feeders are the ones that are the easiest to use and the easiest to clean.

And one of the things we've learned is that almost EVERYTHING needs to be \"scaled down\" in size, for Urban Use, whether it's a patio set that only seats 2 people vs. 8 people; a small grill that can handle a couple of burgers vs. a side of beef, and even bird feeders...yes, even bird feeders.Out in the country, we have 14 feeders, ranging from multiples of suet feeders, feeding platform feeders, tube feeders and thistle feeders. Nary a pigeon, rat nor squirrel in sight, we don't have the problems of feeding birds that plagues Urban gardens.That's why, when I received this feeder, I instantly thought: BALCONY!!!, and that's indeed where it has ended up. Anyone who's ever lived in the city with a balcony knows ALL the problems: too small of a space, too shallow, usually metal railings that support nothing and slats of boards for floors so the 3rd floor is always messing up the 2nd and 1st floor balconies.THIS feeder is just PERFECT for small urban spaces, either vertical (condo) or horizontal (home) which still have no trees in their own garden, due to lack of space. Yes, it can be hung by it's sturdy and handy swivel latch, but it also has a very, very nice key-hole cut out on the back, making it perfect to hang from a simple nail against a wood balcony wall. And since it's so simple to open up the patio door and refill this feeder, it's small size is perfect for filling every other day.We've had NO problems with this feeder. Our metal top, unlike so many other's, fits tightly and snugly...there simply is NO gap between the top and clear walls. For the type of birds we're attracting: Mourning Doves/Chickadees/Finches/and Sparrows, the ample metal perch and strong seed catcher holds every bird that lands. We're lucky, in that a crab apple tree is directly outside of our condo window, so the birds have perched on our porch, forever. We've also had small metal trays of food on our tiny patio table, so they were used to coming to our home for food.We love this feeder. It's definitely a \"niche\" category; I wouldn't use it in a suburban or rural area, simply because there's too many birds that visit those yards and the shape and limited capacity would/could make this problematic. Much larger feeding tubes and platform feeders are the ones that work out there.But, for people who live in tiny spaces that LOVE birds and want to attract them, THIS is a wonderfully thought out feeder. If you have a relative or friend in assisted living, this feeder would be a welcome gift to have outside of their window to enjoy.Bottom line: Our feathered friends HIGHLY recommend it! And we enjoy being able to have our morning tea at the window, enjoying Nature, up close. :D", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Urban Chic for the Urban Peep!", "unixReviewTime": 1394150400, "reviewTime": "03 7, 2014"}

We have had two minor issues with the Genesis and WEBER Customer Service responded immediately and rapidly without any hassles whatsoever.  We have used the Q200 for almost TEN (10) years with outstanding results.  It is, without question, the best &#34;portable&#34; grill money can buy.  So, recently, when we wanted a grill for a high rise condominium balcony which prohibits propane, we immediately turned to Weber.  We decided to order the Q1400 Electric.  Right out of the box we were impressed with the rich appearance and full assembly.  The cord is relatively short (6 foot), but this is understandable for safety reasons.  We wish we would have ordered the optional cart, but a sturdy tempered glass top table served to elevate the grill to a comfortable level for cooking.  Our first meal on the new Q1400 was filet and lobster tail.  We were a bit apprehensive about the performance of the electric grill since we are accustomed to grilling on propane.  However, the Q1400 heated quickly and cooked effectively and evenly.  We could tell little difference between cooking with the electric element versus propane.  Our meal was outstanding.  We are pleased to have found the perfect solution for grilling on a condominium balcony which prohibits propane.  The ONLY negative we can offer is the fact that WEBER has long prided themselves on manufacturing their products in the USA.  This particular model is NOT manufactured in the USA.

It's pesticide free, and ready and easy to use immediately.Does it work?  Yes, it works great on mice, rats, insects, spiders, scorpions, etc.  It also works on pet hamsters, kittens, birds, etc -- so use caution and common sense.Personally, I use mine exclusively for insects/spiders . . . in the garage (hiding it on the floor under a shelf where it collects spiders), and adjacent to a sliding patio door that insects occasionally slip in through.  In the case of the patio door, although the trap is 3/8\" high, I butt it inside against the raised lower frame rail of the door.  Insects do not have to climb to get into the trap, they simply crawl over the rail and down into the trap.  The curious and mobile spiders in the garage also have no problem getting into, and stuck in, the traps.An additional note about the plastic tray design.  I prefer it.  In my patio door application, I had previously used an Ortho Home Defense branded trap, in which the glue is simply deployed on a flat paperboard base.  Over time, the glue slowly melted and migrated onto my doorframe and carpet (where it continued to do its job, but also made a mess).So how about rodents?

He laughed off the snap trap I used, but succumbed to the poison I put out).An additional note - This trap works only by trapping with the glue surface.  It contains no poison or bait.

Getchell \"Evie\"", "helpful": [3, 3], "reviewText": "I'm always game for trying any bird feeder that might make it more difficult for my chubby backyard squirrels to get at the birdfeed, so I was really excited to be offered this one from the Amazon Vine program in exchange for an honest review.After 6 weeks of testing this Perky-Pet 412 platform feeder I have to honestly say that it is a great squirrel feeder but a not-so-great wild bird feeder.  In fact, the only birds who even bother with this feeder in my backyard are those nuisance starlings and grackles.Depending on what I filled it with during my 6 week testing period - seed, suet, peanut nuggets or mealworms - the platform feeder did attract a few species of wild birds at first.  As a full-time resident of the Gulf coast of west central Florida where the birdlife is unusually rich and abundant, I have identified many species at my other bird feeders but only the starlings and grackles continued to visit this platform feeder, especially when I filled it with peanut nuggets or mealworms. (The squirrels, by the way, do not like the mealworms).I positioned my feeder in a nearby tree using a 36-inch \"S\" branch-hook which provides a lot of clearance around the feeder to foil the squirrels. The adjustable dome is designed to wobble and throw the squirrels off balance when they attempt a raid but my squirrels still manage to get under it, tilt the feeder and spill the food. I don't mind this too much though because I also enjoy watching the birds ground feed.The Perky-Pet platform feeder is made in China and requires some assembly. It is easy to assemble but the wire grate that fits overs the metal feeding dish is warped on my unit and is a very poor fit, leaving about a half inch gap allowing the squirrels a better foothold and easier access to the food. I have since removed this grate inasmuch as it serves no good purpose.The distance between the dome and the feeding dish is adjustable but the dome is also a poor fit and sits at an angle, wobbling and bouncing wildly on its spring with the slightest movement of air. It is not a bad looking feeder but I would visually like it better if all of its pieces were a straighter fit and the feeder didn't look so wonky.The feeder requires frequent cleaning which means dismantling the feeder. It's a bit of a hassle to disassemble the feeder twice a week but necessary to prevent disease transmission in birds through decayed and contaminated food.But during the process of frequent disassembling, cleaning and reassembling, I've done a little experimenting with this feeder trying to make it a more successful feeder for wild birds and this is what I've discovered:1. The grate really is useless so I just keep it off.2. The bouncing dome does not deter squirrels. Rather it scares the birds away. So I tried keeping the dome off in order to attract more birds. This didn't really work for attracting desirable birds other than nuisance birds. I also discovered that the dome is actually beneficial for keeping the feed protected from the elements and bird droppings. So I decided to continue using it.3. The dome does work better when I reassemble the feeder without using the spring. The dome wobbles much less and is more steady without the spring and therefore doesn't frighten the birds with that frantic wobbling.After all this tweaking I'm still not satisfied with this Perky Pet feeder. I most definitely would not buy another. Nor would I ever recommend it. In fact, mine has gone in the trash.If you really want a squirrel proof wild bird feeder I highly recommend theBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic. Bromes are expensive but they are worth every penny.

If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won't run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It's not perfect, it's a little bulky compared to what I'm used to, and the handle height isn't adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn't fit you, you're out of luck.  If you're still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I've put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can't mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don't want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I'd always mowed my lawn, it hadn't occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I'd like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I've been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren't fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don't let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn't do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6\") grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it's heavier and bulkier so it's more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don't wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It's a Black & Decker.  I've purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I've overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can't get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won't run out of power because it's cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5'9\") okay, but I'd like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you're shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you've got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It's always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that's both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren't overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn't easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it's easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice mower, and having a cord wasn't nearly as bad as I'd feared", "unixReviewTime": 1402185600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2014"}

I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there's good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren't as good as I'd hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can't comment on that yet.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Updated Review.

My other mower is a 13 year old Toro Recycler 22\" deck with personal pace self-propelled drive.  I've kept that gas engine purring and it's still running strong - Briggs and Stratton make a good engine.  But... it is loud (I mow with ear buds or plugs in) and it's considered not as \"green\" as some current options.  So even though I'm a happy Toro gas mower owner... I thought I'd give an electric a chance.A quick pros and cons for the start here...  remember that I've only assembled and mowed once with it....+ Very light - this is a mower my 6 year old could handle (and no... I don't let her mow).+ packaged mostly assembled - only two Philips head screws to anchor the handle.  The rest is tool-less.+ Significantly quieter than my gas engine mower.  I don't have a SPL gauge, but I can mow without protection and wouldn't get a headache-  17\" deck is a bit narrow.  It sure fits in the garage easy, but I'm adding an additional swipe after every 3 passes to keep up with my 22\" gas mower.  Will be a bit more exercise... and a lawn pattern with more wheel marks.-  Not self-propelled... perhaps this is an observation more than a Con...  It's light, so it doesn't feel like it needs a drive system-  Mostly plastic construction - long term durability?-  Wheels seem less rugged than ones designed for steel deck mowers.Now that we are past the bullets...  Assembly...well the handle attaches with two screws and the upper handle with two tool-less bolts with a hand side wingnuts... they all work well and provide a study feel when complete.The fancy plastic grass catcher comes in 4 pieces...  that's right... 4!  I spent more time inserting tab A into slot B than should be necessary.  The grass catcher is a work of functional art.  Two tone, with a compactor arm built into the unit.  It's a great concept in lawn tech.  I have some concerns over the long term strength over the 4 piece unit versus a molded one piece.  Time will tell if those tabs maintain their strength.  Some additional concerns are the weight.  The plastic catching unit is obviously heftier than a fabric catcher and when full and compacted with grass -- It's likely going to be a lot heavier than the motor deck.  The first spring mow was more of a top off cut than a normal full cut, so I didn't get to witness if the lack of weight in the mower deck and the ability to compact a lot of grass in this catcher turn into a big negative in keeping an even cut through less than ideal slightly bumpy terrain.From a grass catching perspective, it appeared to have less of a \"suction\" than my Toro gas unit.  It would go over leaves without pulling them up into the catcher,  perhaps this will improve when the height of the grass increases, but it's a noticeable different to the gas mower.  Mowing without the catcher in place is possible, but doesn't produce a mulching action when doing a light cut - I will check this again when the grass is higher for the next cut.The front edge of the mower has a molded handle built into the unit.  I'm really not sure of why it's there - the top handle makes more sense.  But with garage space a premium, it looks a great place to use a hook and pulley to pull this mower up and hang it on the wall like my other electric yard tools...  unlike a gas engine; I don't have to worry about it spilling out oil or gas...The height of the mower is changed using a single handle adjustment behind the rear left wheel (its orange in the picture).  When the mower is raised and lowered, the cut gauge on the side reads out in inches...  I think it's great that it is simplified to not have to move each wheel to change height.  Much more user friendly.  My only concern with this method of raising the cut is that it is only raising the back end of the mower to achieve this height, putting the cutting blade at an angle.  This isn't as much of an issue on the grass in the middle of the cut, but the edge cuts won't be at the same even height due to the blade angle.  I don't yet have full enough grass to check the impact of raising it all the way up to 3\"...  but I'm interested in hearing others experiences with cut quality due to this function.The blade had a factory edge on it, which is normal for all mowers...  I'll be giving it a 90 degree sharp edge before the next mow...Handling... I'm used to a heavy mower, doing a little bit of \"Tokyo Drifting\" with a self-propelled unit to slide into the end cuts and radius cuts.  The much lighter deck of this unit is definitely a different feel and seems easy to lift the mower off of its cut angle/depth.  I had to consciously change the way I'm putting pressure on the handle to keep the deck down in walking turns.The balance of the mower feels a little off...  with very little weight in the electric engine and deck and the handle being attached over the rear wheels,  the additional weight of the catcher (especially when full) makes it unbalanced causing the front wheels to easily rise on a bumpy area...  This leads to an uneven cut.  Moving the handle attachment an inch or two forward of the rear wheels should make this tool feel more stable and cut more uniformly.And the biggest difference between gas and electric... the cord.  I've used electric dethatchers and other devices in which you have to be cord conscious, so it didn't cause me too much issue.  But it is a significant consideration in how you mow versus a gas (cordless) mower.  Your mowing pattern has to be cord friendly... and your cord needs to be long enough to support your mowing swipes.  Cord management adds time to the mowing cycle, and even though it was out of the way most of the time, cords get caught up in my shrubs and plants, requiring adept lasso maneuvers to prevent walking to move a cord.Summary?  It's okay.  It may be durn perfect for a very small yard - but that's not my yard.  Even with a light early spring cut, it took enough time additional to the gas mower that it was noticeable - But that's really to be expected when you are dealing with a thinner deck 17\" vs 22\" and power cord management.  The jury is still out on the cut quality - I will add to the review as the grass thickens up.  But the height adjustment angled method is concerning me.  The unit is quieter and gives me green \"street cred\"  if you ignore the fact that Ohio power comes from burning coal...  I'll improve this review as I continue to use the unit this next month.  For now the Gas Toro mower is still hibernating.******Second mow this week at 3\"...  The grass grew like the preferred weed that it is last week with all of the rain.  This time i added a 25' extension cord to my 50' cord to prevent unexpected loss of power from ripping it out of the socket.  That seemed to make my range much more acceptable in swipes across the yard.In the much thicker grass, the lack of a drive engine and the plasticy light nature of the unit made it more difficult to keep a nice clean line. I may just be used to the control of the Toro that makes this easier - I'll mark it off to my lack of skill , but my lines were not very pretty.  Although I could hear the engine audibly bogging a little with the grass cut, the cut seemed clean and the catcher was doing its job.  I could not visibly tell while standing if the cut was uneven due to the height mechanism angling the blade, but getting down to the level of the grass low on my knees, it was visible.  So this mower will not have a straight even cut at max height...  that being said, at that height, such unevenness is hard to detect -- which is the compromise the engineers took for the ease of height adjustment.  At the lower height settings, the blade lowers to level, making a low cut the most even it accomplishes..  when it is the most noticeable.After mowing with it for about an hour, doing the cable dance, and emptying the unit several times... I finally returned to my Toro recycler.  Checked its oil, added gas, primed... and on the first pull it started right up, as if 6 months of dormancy never happened..  I finished the yard faster with the gas mower.So why did I give up?  As I was concerned the B&D; deck is too light.  When the heavy plastic grass catcher was just 3/4 full, it was so heavy that it could not even sit on its own four wheels due to being off balance.  It would fall back and rest on the grass catcher.  This lack of weight down on the front end of the mower leads to an uneven cut due to the front end bouncing, and me always pushing down the front to keep it cutting the grass.It's now hanging on the wall on my garage as a backup if my main mower has issues - but my recommendation is that this unit would only be best for those with very small yards and a willingness to deal with an evolving design that hasn't yet been perfected... to avoid having the maintenance and fuel requirements of a gas mower.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Initial Mow Review - Spring 2014", "unixReviewTime": 1398556800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2014"}

They were fantastic for the first two seasons, but then fell apart.

For bushier tomatoes, I always put the clips closer together near the bottom of the cage, while for leggier tomatoes, I spread them out more.  The GOOD thing is that you can buy extra supports, so you can add as many as you would like.~ Easy-to-Store-- Because this cage breaks down completely, it is VERY easy to store for the winter.~~~~CONS~~~~~ Begins to Crack After One Season, and to Break After Only Two Seasons--  The plastic coating on each stake began to crack at the end of the first season, and by the end of the second season, the steel was VERY rusty and VERY fragile.  The ends had broken off of eight of my twelve stakes by the time I set them up for the third season, and most were in five or six pieces by the middle of season three.~ The Ends Bend Easily-- Despite being made of steel, the ends bend easily, which makes it hard to push these into hard soil.I would absolutely recommend these supports as long as you don't expect them to last season-after-season.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Fantastic for two seasons, but no more", "unixReviewTime": 1399161600, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2014"}

Originally I bought permethrin-infused outdoor wear to ward off the mosquitoes, so I wouldn't have to slather my skin with DEET-based repellent every time I was outdoors.  More recently the Insect Shield clothing has become essential for combating the \"quiet epidemic\" of tick-borne Lyme disease here in New England.  After years of use, I can say unequivocally that permethrin-treated clothing is the absolute best solution for keeping insects at bay.  There have been times in the deep woods when I've been swarmed by mosquitoes and flies -- they'll bite any exposed skin (hands, neck), but they never light on the treated fabric.  It's like a force field.  It works great.  And I've never picked up ticks when wearing permethrin-coated clothes.The only downside, historically, is that I've had to buy shirts and pants that were treated by the garment manufacturer.  It meant I couldn't wear my favorite gardening shirt or my favorite hiking pants.  That's where this product comes in.  I can use it to give my existing clothes an Insect Shield (R) like force field.  It's awesome.  A great solution for outdoor enthusiasts, especially those facing real health hazards from insect bites (where Lyme disease, malaria, and other serious diseases are rampant).  I'm not thrilled about using any chemicals, but I'd rather have the chemicals on my clothes than on my skin.With this can, I treated one complete set of outdoor clothes:  a pair of pants, a shirt, a pair of socks, and a pair of shoes.  I followed the instructions and sprayed each item until it was wet.  I probably could have sprayed a cap, too.As one other reviewer noted, the instructions on the can are unreadable by eyes of a certain age, even with reading glasses.  I know can real estate is limited, but seems like they could have figured out a more user-friendly solution.Bottom line:  Permethrin works, and it works great.  The only question is what's the best way to apply it.  The primary advantage of this aerosol can is that your finger won't get tired from pumping a trigger-sprayer bottle.  But having used both this aerosol can and the Sawyer trigger sprayer, I strongly prefer the trigger sprayer.  It gives me more control, is less messy, and seems to let me saturate the fabric better.  Both use the same ingredient; it's just a matter of which delivery mechanism works better for you. Unless you have arthritis that makes using a pump sprayer difficult, I'd recommend the Sawyer 24 ounce trigger sprayer bottle for the most economical, easiest, least messy application.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Ingredient works great, but pump sprayer works better", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"}

For right off the top I feel I must tell everyone, this is not a conventional flying insect killer.  It does not come out as a fine mist, and it is not designed for just clearing an area of hornets horning in on your BBQ, nor for any kind of indoor use.  It shoots a powerful jet stream of thick  white foam at least a good 15 feet, and easily more.  And it really is designed to be a nest killer.  The powerful stream keeping you from having to get too close to any nest, and perhaps taking one down that is up in a tree from a short ladder, or maybe just from the ground. That being said, this stuff worked pretty well for me. I had to first locate a nest, and that took a while.  I was finally successful when way in my back yard I found an old window box that had been taken over by a large nest of yellow jackets.  They were actively meandering around the nest when I discovered it, so I waited till very late at night before I soaked it.  The foam comes out thick and white, but quickly liquidates and penetrates.  I used about half the can, and then checked it the next morning.  Although a few bees still seemed to be hanging around, they neither went in nor even got at all close to the nest.  It otherwise seemed very dead. I felt comfortable enough to take the nest apart and found a few living larvae inside, but nothing as to adults. They were all either dead, or dying.  I sprayed again what was left and then threw it out...The effectiveness of this seems somewhat mixed here as to some of the other reviews.  But all I can tell you is that it was effective for me in destroying a large active nest, and they have not returned. It's very easy to use, and as noted, I only used half of a can on a nest that was buried in an old window box.  It could very well be that this foam is more effective for some species of bees than others.  And it could also be that some people are not using it at the best time.  Just remember whenever you have a real active nest to take out, hit it with the poison either very late at night, or very early in the morning before sunrise.  That's the only time that all the bees with be in the nest, and the only time you can be pretty sure to get them all.  I did just that and this foam worked very well.

It is a handy size for portability & storage.  We bought the optional stand for it which makes it easier & more comfortable to use.  You can cook 6 steaks with room to spare & then pick up the grill & store it away.  The only downside to the Q200 (Q2200)  compared to the bigger Q3200 is that it takes longer to get ripping hot because it has 1 burner vs. 2 burners on the Q3200.  That  makes a difference in preheating time, getting a good sear and maintaining high heat.  But the Q2200 does a really good job if you just adjust your cooking technique to accommodate the lower heating ability.  It also helps to use a 20 gallon propane tank with the smaller grills instead of those little camping LP bottles.  You will also need to purchase a hose & regulator but it's worth it to improve the grilling capability.The Q3200 is quite a step up in grilling quality.  It has a lot more room, 2 burners & attached cart.  We tried it in very cold winter weather & it heated well (just took a bit longer to preheat), it seared well & maintained heat.  It is impressive for a grill this size.  Our steaks were grilled perfectly with excellent caramelizing on the outside & perfectly medium rare on the inside.It took us about 2 hours to unpack & put this Q3200 together.  The directions are very good and easy to follow.  Give yourself plenty of room to spread out the parts and take your time.  It's not complicated.The LED light is actually a nice feature (I was skeptical).  You can turn it to \"auto on\" & the light will go on as you lift the lid, shining light directly on the grilling grates.  As you close the lid, it turns off.  In the fall/winter we often grill when it's dark so this will get a lot of use.  You can also choose to have it off all the time for when you're grilling during the day.This Q3200 grill is not meant to be as portable like the smaller versions of the \"Q\".  It is attached/bolted to the rolling cart (included) & the 20 pound LP tank (not included) is stored/attached to the inside of the cart.  But, if you have a truck & want to tailgate with a bunch of people, this would do the job.The porcelain-enameled, cast iron grates are very nice but I really wish Weber sold a stainless version.  I don't care how careful you are, the cast iron grates are going to flake & rust (yuck).  We BABY our old Q200.  We store it in a heated room, oil the grates every time it gets used, do not use a steel brush or a brass brush, have never left it in the rain/weather & STILL, the porcelain-coated grates started flaking after about 4 years of light use. If we had used a wire grill brush, I'm sure it would have flaked much sooner.  We use a crumpled newspaper with tongs to gently/thoroughly clean our grates.  We don't want little broken brush wires on the grates & then in our food (this happened with a good brass brush we had used on our charcoal grill).  Everything else on our old Q200 grill is perfect; even the stainless burners.  These porcelain-coated grates are the Achilles heel of the Q grills.Yes, you can replace with ANOTHER set of these same grates but you'll have the same problem; ceramic paint flakes on your food!  We have stainless grates for our big gas Weber & our Weber charcoal kettle grills - they are the BEST.  You still get killer grill marks/searing without the concern of flaking grates.  And we have never had to replace them.PLEASE Weber, MANUFACTURE STAINLESS GRATES FOR THE Q LINE!*I emailed Weber & was told the correct protective cover for the Q3200 is: Model #6553 Premium Cover**Update 4/2014:  I ordered & received the \"Model #6553 Premium Cover\" & it fits the Q3200 perfectly with the side tables folded down.**Update 5/28/2014:  I've been using this grill for 4 months now & really like it.

This disposable bait station has a top which is clear translucent plastic. When the poison is consumed, you can see through the clear plastic, and usually the rodent dies in its dwelling. This can be safely disposed in the trash. Another plus is that this can be used either indoor or outdoor. This is a good alternative to glue-traps that immobilize the rodent and kills slowly and painfully.

Both work about the same.  Light, fluffy, dry leaves work great; wet, sticky ones not so well.  Sticks break the line.The plastic on this feels a bit cheaper, but not by much.  It was a little easier to assemble, mainly because I had trouble getting the stand to fit in the holes on the Flowtron. Because the legs are independent on this, there were no issues with things lining up.I like that the legs are adjustable on the Sun Joe.  I had to jerry-rig a collection container (big plastic garden tub on top of a box) with the Flowtron.  With this, I can adjust the height to fit over the tub.  Attaching a bag with the bungee cords that both units have doesn't work as well as I would have hoped.  When the bags get half-full, they tend to pull out of the elastic.  I also tried putting the Flowtron over a garbage can lined with a heavy duty garbage bag, but when the bag was full it was impossible to lift it out of the can without tearing even the heaviest-weight bag.  Shredding over a bin (which needed to be close to the bottom of the shredder or the leaves went everywhere) and dumping the bin into a bag works best for me.The good thing about the Flowtron is that the whole unit pivots on the stand.  This made it easier to remove the filled bins or bags and also to change the line.  The angle on the line on this unit has the line hitting the bottom of the frame, which seems to wear it out quicker.  I also found the line easier to install on the Flowtron, possibly because of the greater flexibility of their line (I have only used the same brands as the shredder).This is much easier to store than the Flowtron.  The top half clips into the bottom, making it very easy to remove and nest together.  The legs can be unsnapped or shortened and the whole thing put on a shelf.  The Flowtron is best left fully assembled.Basically, I prefer the Flowtron, but if the price difference is big or storage is an issue, either one would work well.

When a property is vacant, I take careof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D;: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H; can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic.

Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down. When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns.

That being said, my feeble attempts at gardening have grown more weeds than produce, so I was quite excited about the possibilities this product posed for my lawn and garden.Unfortunately, the warnings on this product are a bit off-putting. You are cautioned to avoid contact with skin as well as to wear protective eye covering when dispersing this product. If that's the case, I don't think I want it near my food, much less my children. So, we were very careful about where we placed it--on the patio between pavers, and in landscaped areas where the children don't play. Even had it not been for the children, this weed preventer is not supposed to be used on grass, which wasn't clear when we ordered it. Likewise, it does not eliminate existing weeds, just prevents new ones from growing. For me, that was the biggest issue with this product--to have as many warnings as it does, I'd expect it to kill the weeds that already exist.The power spreader cap was actually not something that we found useful. The cap flips open, and the &#34;power&#34; is in the flipped lid. Basically, the product is like pebbles that fall onto the cap and then are dispersed outward. You are supposed to control the flow by tilting the entire bottle up or down, just as you would if you didn't have the power cap. Perhaps it might be different when the bottle isn't near to full, but it's pretty difficult to control the output. And it's not easy to disperse to smaller areas.

Found out that one of the batteries was in crooked; once I fixed that, I was up and running!It is just plain fun AND easy to use this thing.  Just pull out the yellow tab on the bottom, and a little motor whirs to life, doing a very nice and even spread.  Just walk around and watch the fertilizer fly.  I was able to apply fertilizer to my lawn (average suburban size) in about 5 minutes.  This happens to be quicker than pulling out my giant green Scott's push-fertilizer (and much less messy).  And this product takes up less room than my old spreader; just sits on the garage shelf.  The battery life seems good.  It uses four plain old AA batteries, so in future years I'll just pop in some of my rechargeable batteries and will be good to go.The spread pattern was far more even than when my push spreader (or my small hand-cranked spreader) offers.  My old methods always seemed to have certain messy spots with too much fertilizer, and others without enough, but this makes the distribution quite even around the lawn.  The only very minor hiccup I encountered was when the spreader seemed to stop spreading, but I just had to give the handle one quick &#34;heft&#34; and the fertilizer flowed evenly after that.Bottom line, I figured I would be laughing at the product, but instead I will be laughing at the neighbors when I watch them making a mess with their giant push-spreaders.

It is extremely sensitive to lack of sunshine ~ even on days where there are a few clouds in the sky ~ if the sun goes away, so does the fountain!

My birdbath is concrete and it doesn't stick (I didn't expect it to). However, it sits nicely right in the center and doesn't move. The birdbath needs to be kept filled up so that the pump is submerged at all times or you'll risk burning it out.You need to keep that solar panel up high, facing as much of the sun as possible. I'm fortunate enough to have a 6' PVC fence and perch that panel up leaning on one of the fence post caps and it's perfect!

And where I live in Connecticut the deer-tick population is massive and those ticks carry Lyme disease (which I've had, it's miserable--it settled in my knees) and so I fully understand why people turn to products like Cutter to protect themselves. And I *do* use it myself on rare occasion when I know that I'm in a tick-infested area like a wet marsh or meadow. And yes, Cutter does work and probably as well as any other brand.I'm giving it only three stars, however, because the chemical that makes this product work is DEET which is a much more dangerous chemical than manufacturers would lead us to believe. It must be used sparingly and should NEVER be used on babies or very young children. It's far better to cover up the skin that to bomb it with chemicals. Also, remember that there are many natural insect repellants (look them up online, there is a lot written about them) and I grow several scented geranium plants in my container garden every summer to use for repelling mosquitos. Lemon-scented geranium is very simple to grow in a pot and breaking off a few leaves and rubbing them on your skin works very well. Also, you can still buy \"punks\" in some stores and online and if you're just sitting in the yard or in a park/beach, burning a few inexpensive punks will give all the protection you need.So, am I just being paranoid or is DEET actually dangerous? Well, here is what the EPA says on their site:Read and follow all directions and precautions on this product label.Do not apply over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.Do not apply to hands or near eyes and mouth of young children.Do not allow young children to apply this product.Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.Do not use under clothing.Avoid over-application of this product.After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.Wash treated clothing before wearing it again.Use of this product may cause skin reactions in rare cases. The following additional statements will appear on the labels of all aerosol and pump spray formulation labels:Do not spray in enclosed areas.To apply to face, spray on hands first and then rub on face. Do not spray directly onto face.My suggestion with products like Cutter is to spray it on your clothing and not on your skin. Tie a kerchief around your neck and spray that and it will protect your face quite a bit.I'm not trying to trash Cutter here, by the way. I gave the three stars because the product does indeed work quite well. But it would be irresponsible of me to say, sure, slather this on, without acknowledging that there are dangers. I have downgraded it two stars because I think these companies should acknowledge the dangers more--particularly for babies and children. But if you use it sparingly when you are in infested areas and if you wash up afterwards, it's probably an acceptable risk for adults. Lyme disease and West Nile are terrible things and I would have to say the risk of DEET dangers is probably low by comparison--but that does not make it 100% safe. Do some online research and draw your own conclusions. I will carry this Cutters with me (I like the dry-spray, by the way, that's not just hype, it's far less oily) and, when the situation is desperate, I will apply it.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "You must know the dangers of DEET before you use this product", "unixReviewTime": 1398988800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2014"}

Only this feeder broke!! I suspect that it was either weather-worn, OR an old(ER) feeder with limited life to the plastic, OR that it was made of poor cheap material originally.A few feet away, I also had a large barn-type feeder on a pole which was not effected (anchored in cement), i.e., NOT attacked by an animal which the company seemed to want to blame: an animal attack.I wrote MANY times to the mfg for replacement.FINALLY, they said that an animal probably got at it, but they couldn't guess which one.

I said that the other pieces which fell did NOT break, AND that the other barn style feeder, only a few feet away, was not touched, basically ruling out an animal attack in my simple assessment.Last email from mfgr: Their policy was that they could NOT replace the entire feeder!?I asked about the lifetime warrantee again.They asked for photos. I sent them.Then they asked what pieces were intact and which were broken.I wrote that they'd just have to look at the pix because I had never taken the feeder apart and could not say.Answer: NO REPLACEMENT; must have been an animal attack (their words).BOTTOM LINE: Forget the lifetime support.

On one hand this was great, because I had 4 new spools.  On the other hand, I was hoping this trimmer would use thicker string.  I have chain link fence around the majority of my yard, and I would normally go through 3 spools of string each time I used the electric trimmer.  I assumed it would be the same with this Black and Decker LST420 trimmer.  Not the case.  I don't understand it.  Maybe it's because it rotates faster and is more efficient.  I don't know.  Whatever the reason, I am extremely happy about it.For my purposes, I am not a fan of the edging/wheel.  A lot of my sidewalk areas are higher than the yard level.  I found in these areas, the edger didn't work well.  On part of my driveway where they are the same level, it worked fine.  I also had trouble getting close to an area at the base of my porch, because the wheel seemed to hinder the reach of the string.I am very happy with this trimmer, and it is such a relief not to drag around that cumbersome mega-long extension cord (about 100' cord).", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Now I don't hate trimming nearly as much", "unixReviewTime": 1403049600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2014"}

It was pretty easy to assemble; I did not even need to use instructions!  The legs are made from aluminum and are height adjustable (with measurement markings).

I mounted it inside my garbage can, since I didn't have any wide mouth bags that would fit (and it doesn't come with one...)  Ear protection and eye protection are a must as this thing gets very loud and the top is fairly open and could potentiall throw twigs out.  After the first couple handful of leaves, the fine dust coats the hopper and makes most of the leaves slide into the shredder easily.  Sometimes, I used long twigs to help it along.  I confess, it was tempting to use my hands to mush the leaves in, but if you look into the mouth of the shredder, you realize it will take your fingers off and mangle your hand, in less than a second.  I fed this machine a mix of dry pear leaves, pine needles, and twigs of varying sizes.  What I got was some nice mulch quickly which I then dumped promptly into my garden bed. I also got a runny nose from all the fine dust, so if you have a surgical mask, I recommend you wear that too.

Next, press one of the (included) yellow coin-like inserts into each of the red flower-shaped medallions.  The (included) perches will need to be screwed into the underside of the base with a flathead screwdriver (not included). One will find 3 pre-drilled holes, one for each of the perches. When finished, there will be a perch above each of the flower-shaped medallions for the little Hummers to rest on while sipping nectar. Done!The unit is made of a very sturdy, thick, plastic.

The large base, with six feeding ports, easily screws on, or off, the feeding reservoir for refills or cleaning. One fills the reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place via a sturdy metal hanger built into the cap.

Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th.

The feeder gets a lot of clinging bird action, much more than other wired feeders in our yard.  The birds seem to prefer the fly-through openings, and they have no problems pulling out sunflower seed through the wires.  Squirrels extract seeds too, but with difficulty.  They can wriggle through two circular holes at once, with a tail poking out one end and a head sticking out the other.  While that's comical to watch, it's not fun seeing determined squirrels try to bend and break the wire mesh.  The feeder is now off-limits to them.I like the easy-fill cap, all-metal construction, and the fact birds can land anywhere to get a seed.  It does create somewhat of a mess on the ground, but that goes with the territory of bird feeding.  I never tire watching birds at this feeder, especially during wintertime when activity is high.UPDATE:  While the second feeder I just received resembles the first feeder in looks, it is apparent Perky-Pet has cut some corners.  The wire construction (particularly where connecting with the metal framework) is shoddy workmanship.  I can easily push the interior wires in (leaving an open gap).  They used to be solidly connected (soldered) to the metal square and circle framework.  Just imagine what a pesky squirrel could do with those wires now.  The wire itself is no longer coated either, so I wonder how long it will take before rusting begins.  The easy fill cap design has also changed for the worse.  My original feeder's roof clamped down on the body so no thieving varmints could pry it off.  This new one has one of those awful buttons that supposedly locks the roof in place, but every feeder I've used that has one operates poorly.I'm disappointed Perky-Pet took a good product and turned it into junk.

Never to be outsmarted by rodents, I tried a wide variety of anti-gopher weaponry, including this Yard Butler Mole/Gopher Bait Applicator.Likes:*Sturdy metal spike applicator with a t-bar handle and foam grips.*Fairly easy to use: place bait/poison in the top container, insert the spike tip into the gopher hole, and turn the dispenser handle on top to dispense the gopher tidbits (available separately).Results after two weeks:*I don't know whether the gophers were immune to the bait, or the poison actually worked and some other predators dug up their decaying carcasses, but I ended up with newly dug holes around the baited areas along with a good sized mini &#34;pitcher's mound&#34;.Conclusion:Gopher bait/poison did not work for me.  It only aggravated more gophers to dig more holes.  The only dead gopher was one that drowned in my pool, but that was weeks after applying the bait.  Now I'm also concerned about poisoning predators such as hawks, coyotes, possums, and skunks, that are important in the food chain.  I'm not using any more gopher bait/poison, but this applicator is very handy as a probe for locating gopher tunnels and implementing other weapons of rodent destruction.

It also has a nice battery saving feature as it will turn itself off after 45 minutes if no buttons are pressed.

But two properties have a 1/4 acre yard with quite some think grass and some heavy vines also. My battery-based trimmer can barely handle the thick grass and it always struggles with the vines.I am glad to get the more powerful gas trimmer. This Remington RM2510 Wrangler is pretty lightweight...about the same weight of my 40V battery-based trimmer. The included manual gives very clear instructions about how to prime the engine and how to start it. I have no problem to start the engine. This is my 1st time to use gas-powered tool, and I am surprised how easy to start the engine. So far, based on my limited usages in one month, it usually starts within 3 pulls. The start-up instruction is also printed on the air filter hosing. So, no worry to keep the manual book around.Though it is more noisier than my battery-based trimmer, it's still in an acceptable range. This trimmer balances itself quite well. Even better yet, the curved shaft makes the trimmer head in parallel position against ground when I stand up-right. This really eases my back, especially when I use this trimmer for long period of time on the 1/4 acre yard.When it runs, the shaft does vibrate, which does not occur to my battery-based trimmer. After 40 minutes of usage, my arm does not feel sour. So, I think the vibrtion is not that bad.The trimming line is about twice as thick as my battery-based trimmer. I guess the line will last longer. When in high rpm, this trimmer sweeps through thick grass like chopping off cake with knife. And it rips though the vines easily.The package comes with a bottle of oil to be mixed with gas by user. However, the 40:1 pre-mixed gas can is widely available in Home Depot or Lowes already. The pre-mixed gas is in an easy-to-use metal can. Better yet, they add gas stabilizer additive to keep the gas last longer in the can.

Too much  run-off and leaching of phosphorus used to fertilize lawns can lead to the excessive build-up of algae and weeds in nearby lakes. For that reason, some areas suggest that you limit phosphates in lawn fertilizers to help preserve the local environment and  pose less of a threat to groundwater.  PHOSPHATES MAY EVEN BE ILLEGAL IN SOME AREAS.Mature lawns will have a lower requirement for phosphates.As this fertilizer has 0% PHOSPHATES, It can be a very helpful fertilizer.

I believe the birds like it for the larger holes/access ports. The squirrels have left it alone (or gave up on it) as we haven't seen any on or attempting to gain access to the feeder. That being said they do sit underneath it and wait for the picky bird eaters to throw down the seeds they don't like. Smart little rodents. The colors and materials which are metal are quite nicely painted and coppered. The only part that concerns me tis the plastic sheeting windows. They seem a bit on the thin side, I am presuming so they can be bent to fit the curve of the feeder, but I question how long they will survive summer heat and winter cold. I will update the review should they ever wear out. For now they are holding strong and allow us to see when the feeder is getting low. Glass would be a nicer alternative but would likely drive up the price of the unit.The other part I don't care for, but I suspect is part of the squirrel retardant features is that the wire loop it hangs from creates a lot of movement when a feathered friend comes to land on one of the stems. The feeder rotates around the wire and spins at a moderate rate until resting again naturally. This doesn't seem to bother the smaller birds, but the jays and cardinals don't care for it and pick the older feeder that has a sold bracket and does not spin.Overall I am happy with this unit so far and would give it 4 stars.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice option, Good to look at, a bit moving", "unixReviewTime": 1395273600, "reviewTime": "03 20, 2014"}

It looks similar to this, but has only round holes (I like the round and square on this), a copper colored top, and a platform on the bottom.  I can't find it on Amazon to provide a link.  It has been one of the birds' favorite feeders, especially the chickadees.  I fill it with black oil sunflower seed and they like having all of the places to access the seeds.  I have trouble with deer in my feeders and they tend to leave these alone, possibly because tilting them does not allow all of the seed to fall out.  Although the feeders don't provide seed protection from the elements, they empty it quickly enough that it has never been an issue and I have never had a feeder filled with rotten seed.There are a couple of drawbacks with both feeders.  The &#34;fly through&#34; holes allow small birds to perch while eating, but they also take up a lot of space, so the feeder does not hold a whole lot.  The squirrels also can access the seed and they break the wire.  This makes it difficult to fill the feeder without losing lots of seed.  Even new a fair amount of seed comes out the sides, so I fill it over a platform feeder.  The platform the other feeder has on the bottom catches some of the seed that falls out during use.  This does not have the platform.  The other feeder's copper top is also more attractive than this plain black one.Still, this has quickly been just as popular with the birds as the copper version.  Due to the size of the holes, it is really only suitable for sunflower seeds in the shell, but that is the most popular seed in my area, so that is no problem.

Other feeders occupy hanging space but not one of them is as popular as any of the Perky-Pets.  The birds must know quality better than most.  This one is glass and frankly, I am a glass snob with vigor.  Glass cleans better and lasts longer while apparently not leaving any residue from cleaning.Let's start at the moat top.  Instead of having to arrange a separate contraption such as I have previously and will do again this year, this feeder has an area in the top that permits visitors from below to stop by and drown.  I've always wondered if the dead creatures would be eaten by the hummers, but I have no evidence of that taking place.  But I always look.  The red top unscrews to permit full cleaning of the glass container.  I used a metal rod for holding plants to stakes to configure a tie down for the top's hanger.  It works well for me and I can control the size.The pinch waist permits more steady control of the feeder when holding or going from one location to another, but the real sensible addition to this feeder is the hummers' goodies (food) goes into the bottom instead of the top.  Picture turning the feeder upside down with the top engaged onto the glass feeder and pouring the food into the feeder while it is sitting on the sink.  When you have filled the feeder to the level you want, screw the bottom of the unit while still upside down and carry it to the feeder.  At that point turn the unit over and place it on the Shepard's hook or whatever you use to hold the feeder.  The incidence of spillage will reduce immediately.  (As was said by someone who could spill a steel rod.)After screwing the roosts onto the main unit and assuring their proper place in front of the little feeder holes the rest is as simple.  The bottom consists of two pieces which helps with keeping the entire unit clean and the hummers appreciate it.Right now, this unit has jumped from last to first in one week's use.

It falls somewhere between my go toToro 51480 Corded 14-Inch Electric Trimmer/Edgerwith Walk-Behind Edging and theBlack & Decker GH710 GrassHog 14-Inch 6.0-Amp Dual-Line Trimmerthat I got completely frustrated with and took back to Lowe's. I have to say, though, this Remington is definitely the heaviest string trimmer I have tried. I don't know if it's because of the powerful motor or sturdier materials, but this thing weighs a ton. And despite the adjustable handle, at its longest it is too short for me (I'm 5'11\") and causes significant back strain. It also adjusts head angle and switches over to an edger, but the kludge-y design requires physically moving and adjusting the handle when changing between functions. Also, there are lots of buttons for making the adjustments, so to get the most out of the trimmer - and in some cases just to operate the thing at all - you will have to read the manual. There are some pluses among all the drawbacks though.For use as an edger, they supplied a guide wheel that allows you to set the thing down on the sidewalk, so at least when edging you don't have to support the entire weight of the device. I also liked the double string head, which really tears into grass quickly, easily, and cleanly, taking everything out in just one pass. The feed mechanism is like the Toro's, where you have to stop the engine \"for two seconds\" then restart it to feed about a quarter inch of line. This works sporadically at best and requires good timing and patience. After a short while, I learned to listen for the feed \"click\" and knew I was good to continue on, but practically speaking, it's slow going when you can only go two feet or so before having to wait a few seconds (or more for multiple feeds to catch up on the correct length) before continuing with the operation. Still, with all the power supplied, when you have the line out, its quick work and as I said, does the job in one pass. I haven't had to change the line yet, but I suspect it is more or less like every other double-line string trimmer and that will be a pain as well. (No way around that, though, so no stars deducted for that.)Overall, this has some good features and some not so good features. For a stronger, shorter person, this might be just the trimmer for you.

It's been about three years since I last washed the siding so it was pretty dirty and had a nice collection of pollen in the nooks and crannies. I have a pressure washer but I used the optional application given on the label and mixed 12 oz of HS01 with one gallon of water in a garden pump can. I wet the siding with a garden hose and then sprayed the Krud Kutter solution, working from the top down, making sure to give it a n even soaking. I waited about 10 minutes then sprayed it off with the garden hose. Some of the shaded areas had mildew growing and I had to lightly scrub these areas with a soft bristled brush on an extension pole. But the over all process with just using the solution did loosen the dirt and pollen and the hose spray washed it all off. I would consider this average results when using this method without using a power washer. After touching up some areas and brushing some of the white trim, I let it all dry. The house looks like it has a fresh coat of paint. It took two and one half gallons of mixture to complete my siding on a 1 1/2 story home that is mostly vinyl finish.Other observations: my front porch is painted concrete and my outside doors are steel. The Krud Kutter cleaned all of this with just a spray down and then hosing it off. The white trim is very bright after cleaning it, however, the white gutters had stains from rain drips and the downspouts have black stain (not mold). This product did not remove the black stains. I didn't try it on my wood deck, as there are products that are made to do that job specifically. I don't like to use my power washer on my vinyl, just a personal preference. I washed a patch of the concrete driveway, in order to use up what was left in the last pump can. the solution lightened the concrete by removing ground-in dirt, but only slightly.

For my grills and smokers, I know that sentence makes me sound like a pyromaniac, but I am not.  I normally use charcoal for the grills and smokers, sometimes I use wood chunks.

We would rather boil a rack of ribs than use lighter fluid to start a grill.I normally used some newspaper at the bottom of my charcoal chimney.  It works great 90% of the time.

And there was no way I would consider not grilling a juicy steak just because it is windy outside.  Then I tried these fire starter cubes and they work great in the chimney too.  I put in some coals, then the fire starter, light it, then add more coals.

I had wanted an egg for many years, but they are expensive, and seriously, are they really even worth the extra money.  Turns out they are worth it.  On my third smoking session with the egg I cooked a packer brisket for 15 hours in single digit weather.

I fill the fire ring with charcoal then make a small depression in the coals and place half of a fire starter in that depression.  I light the fire starter, let it burn for about 20 seconds, then push some larger chunks of charcoal over it and in minutes my egg is light and i can start adjusting the temperature.

So it is true with pigeons, who are known to carry diseases that are very harmful to humans. They also leave a mess where they roost. In my climate pigeons tend to make their homes in areas that help to keep them out of the hot sun. I don't wish to harm them, only to discourage them from roosting in certain areas where their droppings have the potential of spreading disease or disfiguring the exterior walls of the house. In my house there are really only 2-3 such areas, one of them right over the front entrance door.Previously we had used \"chicken wire\" to prevent the pigeons from roosting in these areas.  However it is unattractive and it is possible the birds could become enmeshed in the wire, which is not the intent.During a recent whole-home remodel in which the exterior was repainted, we removed all of the chicken wire and added Bird B Gone spikes in the two areas in which pigeon droppings could potentially fall on children, guests or food.  We started with the stainless steel spikes and also wanted to compare the Lucite spikes which cost less.  This review compares the two.Despite the fact that the Lucite spikes are clear, the stainless steel spikes actually call less attention to themselves. Both have pointy ends that discourage unwanted guests from roosting but neither would be considered harmful or lethal to wildlife as they are more of a deterrent.The pro for the metal spikes is that they are shiny and wave in the wind which makes noise, all of which discourage the birds before they even get near. The downside of that is that the vibration can get a little annoying to humans in the house. For any given length they are a bit lighter than the plastic version.  Another downside is that the cost is quite a bit more.The pro for the plastic spikes is that they cost less and are equally as effective. They are very rigid and do not vibrate. But the clear material is also shiny and will most likely discourage a bird before it even comes close. I tried to break off a spike of the plastic variety and it did not break easily. Time will tell which best survives harsh weather conditions (I will update this review if I find any huge advantages of one over the other).A couple of final observations ...1. Installation with glue is much easier than installing with screws. Nobody wants to make screw holes in their roof nor glue anything to it but it's a necessary evil and let's face reality, most people will never remove bird spikes once they are installed.2. If you use glue be sure to put a dollop of glue where each screw hole is. The glue will ooze through the hole and act as a very strong screw to help hold the strip down.3. Be sure to let the spikes hang over the edge of the mounting surface 1 - 2\". This will help discourage the birds before they start to roost.4. Try mounting the strip with the spikes pointing out rather than up (this works especially well with the plastic strips). This mounting will be just as effective with almost no risk of harming the bird or catching debris.  In my installation it also makes the Lucite plastic spikes much less visible from street level.If birds are a nuisance or potential health hazard where you live, bird spikes can be a worthwhile way of telling the birds to seek shelter elsewhere without harming them. Bird B Gone seems to own the residential market for such products (although there are many, more expensive, solutions) and they are reasonably well made. They are not cheap but after all this is one of those expenses you do once and shouldn't have to think about again for many years down the road.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very effective and humane", "unixReviewTime": 1396828800, "reviewTime": "04 7, 2014"}

Plugging the LED lights into the control unit there is ample cord to extend the lights to the extremities of our 30 foot long deck.  We let the unit charge all of one day before trying it and it worked perfectly.  The lights lit up the deck area sufficiently to read outside if you wish, and the lantern was bright enough to light areas of the yard as we walked.However, the 2nd night we had a heavy snowfall accompanied by freezing rain and the unit put out very little power.  I suppose it is similar to all solar panels and subject to that limitation.  As the weather breaks this SHS will be moved to the back of our lot to light the storage sheds.

In fact, if I have to name one aspect of this rain barrel I like best, it would be the solid, sturdy design. It seems like it can stand up to the elements and withstand any type of inclement weather. Lucky for me, it doesn&#8217;t snow where I live but the durable design is good for those who live in harsher climates.With its attractive, neutral design, this rain barrel matches up well with most outdoor d&eacute;cor and I like that it has two spigots for convenience. There is also the ability to place a plant on top, as you can see in the picture. I haven&#8217;t done this and, given how shallow the space on top is, I don&#8217;t know if placing a plant here is really a good idea. If it was deeper, perhaps so, but it&#8217;s so shallow that most plants won&#8217;t fare very well.The things that bother me a little with this rain barrel are its lack of a removable top and issues with installation. There is a screen on top to help prevent debris and bugs from getting inside. And it&#8217;s a good thing the rain barrel has this because there is no way to open the top for cleaning. The best you could do is remove the small screen and try to find something narrow to stick through the small opening for cleaning. The screen will keep out leaves and other things, but if the barrel gets smelly and needs an interior cleaning job, there is little you can do.With the installation, I did have some small issues and concerns. You need to place this rain barrel directly under a downspout and because it is so tall, that will likely mean removing a large section of your downspout in order to fit the rain barrel underneath. Depending on your particular downspout design, it could be a problem and you may have to cut off a portion of the spout to get it situated just right. Then, there could be issues with the spigots. They provide tape to help form a good seal, but only time will tell if the seal holds up and the water doesn&#8217;t leak.Overall, however, I like the Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel and recommend it for most homes.

I have maybe 30 or so at this time. Probably half of the plants I have are Christmas cactus (schlumberga russelliana mostly)and while they are pretty foliage wise through out the entire year, the shorter days towards November and December cause them to flower, thereby giving these plants the common name of Christmas cactus.and they will come back every year, provided you keep them  in natural sunlight until the buds set on them. (No indirect light at night, it will mess up the blooming time.)Christmas cacti are fairly fragile when you repot them or move them, Sometimes there are loose segments that you can grow into a new plant. A good Christmas present is easy to make from the loose segments and the Take Root Rooting Hormone.Now you don't absolutely _need_ the Take Root Rooting Hormone.  You can put the little segments in a cup of water and they will take a few weeks to root providing they don't rot.  You could stick them in dirt and they will probably root if they don't dry out. Either of these strategies will take quite a few weeks to see it the segments actually do root.If you take a segment of a Christmas cactus and put the tiniest bit of the Take Root rooting hormone on the open stem and place it in dirt (and keep the dirt just a little damp), the segment will root much quicker and grow stronger than if you just use the water or dirt method. You can cut segments, dust them with the rooting hormone and quickly have a thriving pot of Christmas cacti, If you want to make sure you have tem ready for a Christmas gift, you must root them at least 6 months prior to December to ensure bloom, This  time will allow the plants to become well established.Of course, you can use the rooting hormone for any plant you want to.

Although not a vegetarian, I'm not a hunter, and choose to leave wildlife be when I can.  I feed birds in the winter, etc.  However, there are times when nuisance encroaching animals just have to go.  I prefer to live catch and relocate (rats are an exception, and I have readily resorted to poison).  I've owned and used a larger Havahart for years, having great success at trapping and relocating everything from nuisance possums, to raccoons, to poaching cats on the farm.  My early impression with this smaller trap, is that it is much easier to trap the larger varmints than the smaller ones. The smaller animals have much less body weight, and of course can maneuver in remarkably small spaces, and their survival instincts lead them to be quite inventive.I took this offer for the Havahart 1061 from Amazon to specifically try to thin out  the gray squirrel traffic here at my in-town home.  The grays are much smaller than the larger red squirrels and I thought I'd try this small trap.Features on this trap are Two-Door access (one on each end),  the &#34;Easy Set&#34; system, 17.25&#34; length, 5&#34;x5&#34; opening.  I don't know how to account for some the of the bad experiences in the other reviews, but setting the trap that I received is a breeze!  Simply rotate the setting handle back, and the cable system sets the trap nicely.The 5&#34;x5&#34; opening sounded awfully small, but when finally viewing live, I knew it would be just right for my gray squirrels.  And it is.  Two catches already using peanuts, and also a catch and release small bunny (they are relatively few here and not a problem for me).  I took the squirrels to a nearby lake/park location where there are plentiful walnut trees (yum!).  I have had  a couple incidences of finding an empty tripped trap . . . maybe an escape, but more likely tripped from an outside disturbance . . . this trap is sensitive!  I've also had a couple incidences of stolen bait . . . on that I suspect the local blue jays, which have displayed a vigorous taste for peanuts (I had tossed peanuts out, no trap, for several days in advance to &#34;bait the area&#34;).  I suppose a blue jay is also capable of being caught in this thing - maybe so far they've stayed off of the tripping platform.I will definitely keep this trap on hand for any future mice or (forbid) another rat.  No subject nuisance mice targets yet, so I'll have to take Havahart's word that it works on mice.  The mesh is small, but so are mice.  And the tripping mechanism is sensitive, but mice don't weigh much.  We'll see. I DO like the notion of using this for mice, rather than the traditional wooden neck breaker mouse traps I have used in the past on mice (mice seem nice, but just don't want them in my home).In all, great trap, typical from Havahart:  Sturdy, easy to set, sensitive, and not injurious to animals (notwithstanding the trauma of being caught in the trap . . . so please monitor a set trap often and relocate and release immediately).", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "No brainer setting.

This applicator has two main advantages over placing mole bait by hand. First, if you use latex gloves to load it, you can avoid human odor on the bait, which may render the bait useless given the sensitive noses of moles. Second, of course, you can apply the bait in various places around the yard while standing, and when finished simply hang the applicator in your yard shed or garage.I've found that, although the process is quite simple, it can be tricky to get the bait pellets in the right spot. The tunnels are easy to spot in most lawns and gardens, but placing the bait is important. Even if you happen to collapse part of the tunnel, moles love to reopen them if it means getting at some food. However, I think it is best to cover the hole left by the applicator with some dry leaves and a little soil on top of that. This way, the bait is somewhat protected from other creatures and the weather, plus it is easy to see where bait has been placed if you wish to check on whether it's been eaten.Bottom line: if you have a mole problem and tried a number of approaches to getting rid of them, this applicator may help.

{"reviewerID": "A34CSXOGVYF94S", "asin": "B00HH4K8E0", "reviewerName": "Joel Avrunin \"Electrical Engineer who loves S...", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewText": "**** See update below for why I knocked it down to 2 stars.  Original review is here: ****I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004. It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and \"upgraded\" to the MM1800, the 18\" corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn't feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick (the motor blew out and smoked).  I replaced it with aGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerand never looked back - that was a great corded mower and I used it until I found this new B&D; Mower.For mowing my own lawn, I did not consider gas because I don't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I have always relied on corded mowers because I felt the battery operated ones would be too weak and I didn't want to deal with battery management.  Cords are a fine option, but sometimes you do want the freedom of a battery.All of that being said, B&D; really did a nice job with this battery operated mower, and for the first time in my adult mowing life, I think I might be back to both B&D; (and using battery operation).Opening the box, I found the mower in 3 pieces.  The battery was pre-installed (with half-charge), so all I had to do to assemble the mower was attached the handle.  The handle attaches in 2 parts.  You need to unscrew the 2 bolts on each side and screw them back in, but once installed, they loosen with a simple lever.  This allows you to collapse the handle easily for storage.  I have had \"easy fold\" handles before, but this one is actually easy.  The mower is very light, and with a handle on top of the body of the mower, I was easily able to lift it up and put it away in my crawl space.  I could do that with a gas or my previous corded mower.The mower includes two 40V B&D; LBXR2036 Lithium Batteries.  It says it is compatible with the lower voltage 36V LBXR36 batteries, but gives no indication of the performance difference.  This could be important because the 36V batteries are $80 and the 40V are $110.  So understand that you are getting over $200 worth of batteries with this mower and that is likely where much of the cost lies.  The batteries are the new Lithium Ion batteries which should hopefully not hold memory like the old NiCad.  You also get a really nice charger which has \"smarts\" to let you know when a battery is charged.  Each battery also has a \"power gauge\" to let you know how much power is left.Enough about the batteries - how does it mow?  I went outside shortly after it rained for the first mow of the season.  Yes - I was challenging the mower on all fronts.  I plugged in the safety key (great feature to keep your mower off when you aren't around - it appears to be \"smart\" and won't let you just short out the terminals).  I also decided not to bag initially.  The deck height setting is very easy - a single lever adjusts the deck.  I tried on setting 2 and made it surprisingly far until I bogged down the mower (no surprise - the grass was tall and wet).  Most impressively, the mower stopped on tall grass and didn't burn out like my older corded mowers did.  It appears to know not to destroy itself.  You have to actually turn it off and then back on to get going, a nice feature to prevent you from overstressing the motor.  I set it higher (to 6) and mowed just fine.In terms of performance, I was able to mow my backyard with 1 battery and my front yard with the other.  Each worked for about 20 minutes (not quite the 30 advertised).  The mower cuts off quickly when the battery is dead, so no period of \"weak mowing\" when you're not sure if you should replace it.  When it's dead, it's dead.The bag is very easy to attach and you don't need to fight to keep it open like other bags.  It can't hold much, so you'll be emptying it a lot on heavy grass.A few other notes - the mower is very easy to turn and navigate thanks to the wide tires and oversized rear tires.  Unfortunately they are plastic (not rubber or real tires), but they seem to get the job done.  The mower is a total of about 17\" wide, so it will fit into very tight space, but it also means you might need to make more passes on your lawn than a wider mower.Overall, I was able to mow easily and certainly appreciated not having to handle cord management.  If you have a yard that can be mowed fully in 40 minutes and you don't want to mess with power cords, this mower is certainly a fine choice.  All of that being said, be aware that you can get a high quality corded mower (like the Greenworks 25022) for a little more than the cost of 1 battery for this mower.  It makes the decision an economic and personal one - is it worth twice the cost to you to get a mower that is lighter and does not require a cord?  If the answer is \"yes\", then you will be quite happy with this B&D; Mower.**** UPDATE 5/15/2014 ****Sadly I had to knock it down to two stars today.  While mowing, I hit a few rocks which is common around here (very rocky soil).  My old Greenworks mower has a few small dings on the blade from hitting rocks, but it's been going strong for years with the dings.  However, the small ding knocked the B&D; CM1640 totally out of balance.  It started vibrating and shaking while I mowed.  I hit a few more small rocks and it got worse.  These weren't giant rocks mind you, but small ones that I have accidentally mowed with countless other mowers.  As I pushed on, the mower caught a root and it was all over.  The blade literally bent 90 degrees (see photo I uploaded).  It is now trash.  Maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about rocks, and maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about roots?  Both are possible, but all I can say is that I abuse my Greenworks mower and every season it starts right up.  I have hit quartz, granite, and just about everything else in my yard, and it is still humming.So why do I think this happened?  I have a theory - it's a battery operated motor meaning they need to optimize everything to draw the lowest amount of current possible.  Looking at the blade, it appears they have made it thinner and lighter than a typical blade so it spins fast without drawing as much current.  The downside is what I just discovered - a fragile mower that breaks easily.One other thing I discovered - the batteries cannot be recharged immediately because they tend to get too hot.  The charger won't charge them.  So you can't recharge battery 1 while you mow with battery 2.  Another issue!I am going back to myGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerwhere you can read my review of that fine mower.  Once again I left it outside, under my deck, all winter, and it finished up my yard for me today great.

I have a very large (~10,000 sf)  and somewhat hilly lawn, and for the past 15 years I've used a big, twin-bladed, 33\" cutting path, 10.5 hp, self-propelled, four-speed, semi-pro Craftsman lawnmower.  It was fast (I could do the whole yard in 40 minutes), but it was loud and required all the usual small-engine maintenance.I just mowed the lawn for the first time using the Greenworks battery-powered mower and I couldn't be happier.  I expected it to take much longer, because of the narrower cutting path, but it went faster than I expected because the mower is so light and maneuverable that I wasted less time doing turns.  I was worried about it not being self-propelled, but again the light weight of the mower really made a difference.  It was more of a workout that walking behind the Craftsman self-propelled mower, but not bad at all.  I'd liken it to pushing a high-wheeled stroller with an infant on board.On this first pass, I took off the bag and used the mower in mulching mode.  It worked very effectively, including on the occasional pine cone.  My grass is mostly fescue, which is fairly thin, and the mower cut it easily and evenly.  In a couple of thicker patches the electric engine rev'd up automatically and handled the denser turf just fine.Starting the mower is very simple -- push one button and pull back the lever.  Much more convenient than starting my old lawnmower with its pull cord.  One delightful (and unexpected) advantage is that the mower is much quieter than my old gas mower.  I always used to wear ear protection when mowing, but didn't need to with this electric mower.  My family reported that it was also much, much quieter inside the house.One thing I'm looking forward to is the lack of maintenance and not having to prep the mower for winter storage, or change the oil, or store gas.I can charge the batteries from our solar panels, which makes this a very green solution.  I was surprised to learn recently that small gas-powered engines in lawn equipment are very dirty compared to modern cars, so this small change of mower makes a big difference in terms of my environmental footprint.The mower comes with two batteries, a 4ah and 2 ah.  Both can be installed at the same time, and the mower automatically switches to the second battery when the first runs out.  Unfortunately, the combination was not quite enough to finish my lawn.  Two 4ah batteries would be sufficient, and I wish this option were available when purchasing the mower.  A second 4ah battery is pretty expensive, but because Greenworks prices its bundles (i.e., piece of equipment together with a battery and charger) pretty aggressively relative to the cost of batteries alone, you can get a spare battery at fairly low marginal cost if you buy multiple Greenworks products.  As it turned out, I also wanted a cordless electric leafblower, so I ordered a Greenworks leafblower plus battery and I now have three interchangeable batteries, which is more than enough for my lawn.Bottom line:  This mower cuts smoothly and evenly, mulches well, does an average to large lawn on one charge, is light enough to push without needing to be self propelled, is much quieter than a gas mower, needs less maintenance than gas-powered small engines, and is seriously green (especially if you have solar panels like we do).  For me, it makes mowing a lot more fun (or at least a lot less of a chore).  Two thumbs up.Update May 5:  I ordered this mower through Amazon.  I ordered some additional items directly from Greenworks website.  One of the packages arrived, but another got lost in transit.  I emailed Greenworks over the weekend and received a reply first thing this morning that they would ship a replacement today.  Couldn't ask for a faster or more complete resolution.  So, in addition to really liking the product, I'm also impressed by the responsiveness of their customer service.

They distinguish themselves with the best grills I have ever encountered: nice heavy porcelain cast iron. The grills heat evenly and provide great results.I have only had propane Webers before. So I was very intrigued about how an electric grill would work and the results. Well the results are fantastic. The body is very well engineered. It provides a nice seal which essentially makes the grill a convection oven. The taste is very 'clean'. but you still get grill flavor. But your seasoning and the nice quick sear is what is giving you flavor. There is no slight gas flavor, which is a plus to me.Steaks have come out heavenly. But bone-in chicken, wow. Moist, crisp, tender, juicy. I put it perhaps a little past medium high as recommended for the chicken but it came out great. The steaks were on high and so juicy.There are a couple of limitations to be aware of. There is a suggested 20 minute warm up time before you put food down. I have followed this. Certainly for steaks on high you want the grill to be nice and warm. But you should be aware of that before ordering if that is a concern. Second there is 'only' a 6 foot cord and they suggest you don't use an extension cord. This is a problem for us and I would suspect for others. We can reach an outlet from a table, but it is stretched across off the ground. Not good if you have little kids. Of course if you buy a cart this is not a problem.One other small suggestion. Put the handle on before you attach the cover in back to the main body. It was awkward to attach the handle after the top was connected. But overall very little assembly.Even with the small issues this was easily a 5. I am finding myself not wanting to use my other grills.

The jar is sealed at the top - to refill, unscrew the top and bottom, flip it over, clean, and pour in the solution.  Ours leaked the first day until we realized we needed to turn the flowers so the clips would hold them tighter - presto, no more leaks!  The perches can be removed if desired, but it is really cool to see hummingbirds perched - which they do about 1/3 the time when feeding.For the \"nectar,\" we dissolve 1/2 cup white sugar in 2 cups plain boiling water; be careful about adding anything else as it could be harmful to the hummingbirds.

I have tried a wide variety of traps and poisons for moles, but not all of them have worked, but this one works if you follow the instructions correctly. I think some reviewers have expressed regrets over this product not working for them. The trick is that you have to plant these pellets where the pests can see, and generally in their traffic paths or tunnels actively used. I use a hard wooden stick or a metal rod to pierce a hole in the mound and detect the tunnel, and then drop a teaspoon full of pellets. Generally the holes are below the surface and the stick gives a reasonable measure of where the tunnel is. There are hits and misses, but you have to follow it up at least once a week to see if there is a new mounds in the yard. Apply there and wait for couple of days to see the results. Be persistent, it is a tiring procedure, but it works.On the lesser side of this mole \"poison\" is the product description on Amazon.com product page.

I've used the Hound Dog brand of aerator for years with good results and  was eager to give this Yard Butler brand a try.Likes:*Coring aerators punches out a soil &#34;plug&#34; which is better than spike aerators that just pushes/compacts soil around the holes.*Simple to use, just step on the lower bar to aerate the soil and push out the plugs.  Logic dictates that placing the aerating tubes perpendicular to the lawn will result in less effort and plugs cleanly punched out.*T-handle for a good grip when lifting up the aerator.*Newer design with beveled, smaller diameter lower section of aerator tubes resulted in less plugs stuck inside.What I've learned over the years of aerating lawns:*Only need to aerate dry, brown, troubled spots, NOT the entire lawn.*The soil need to be just right: Too damp, DON'T need aerating, and the plugs will get stuck.  Too dry, aerating tubes can't punch through and the cutting edges are dulled. The solid needs to be just damp enough for the aerating tubes to punch through and cleanly push out the plugs.*The old Hound Dog aerator just has an unbreakable U-shaped handle, unlike the Yard Butler aerator which has a welded T-handle.  I'm extra careful not to push down on the handle, and just lift the handle gently during removal from the soil.*Some damp plugs will get stuck occasionally, just push it out by stepping on some slightly damp soil.  I wouldn't use a screwdriver to pry out the plugs because that may roughen up the inner surfaces of the aerating tubes and cause more plugs to get stuck.*Just get a tube or stick that's slightly smaller in diameter than the aerating tubes and punch out the stuck plugs.*Be careful not to bend or distort the cutting edges will lead to more stuck plugs.Overall:Good for treating sections of troubled, brown, dried lawn.

While I'm generally comfortable working with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowers, I welcome knowledgeable advice. That's why I was eager to put this helpful Parrot to work.I'll focus here on showing how the Parrot works out of the box and what it's like tapping into the specific data you gather and augmenting your knowledge with the plant library the app provides. Thus far, the unit and app both seem to be working well (including the day I let my plant dry out to see whether that would trigger a \"water me\" alert, which it did).Since I \"drive\" the Parrot with my phone, I was able to snap some screen shots for you. I've placed them, with annotations, in the customer images section on the product page.  These shots include live-action shots and historical data. The app archives data so that you can review in daily, weekly, and monthly view.  The Parrot unit gathers and stores data and transmits it via Bluetooth. The Flower Power app communicates with the \"Parrot Cloud\" by way of 3G, 4G or wifi.Setup is simple, but remind yourself that it takes at least 24 hours for the Parrot to generate its first report. In the meantime, you can dig into the Flower Power database, and start building your \"garden,\" by selecting other plants with which you will want to work. Each time your search nets a result, you can add that plant to your garden. You can personalize entries by taking photos of your plants, or use the images provided in the database. You have access to 6,000 plants.Be sure that the Flower Power app recognizes your physical location; this simple but necessary step helps with future use. Indeed, during initial use, I received notification that an update for my location (Hawaii) was available; depending on your location, you may receive a similar prompt.Speaking of locations, I am in Zone 10, which isn't ideal for some of the plants I would like to grow. However, I've checked through the app and located support for several flowers I plan to grow this year, including particular varieties of crocus and tulips. In years past, I've had varying results with these plants, so I hope that the Parrot will mean a better outcome this year.In order to make best use of the app, I would need to have multiple Parrot units. The workaround I've been using is to move the Parrot from one plant to the next on a weekly basis. In several more months, I will evaluate the overall benefit of the Parrot unit and the Flower Power database, and decide whether to buy additional units.If you have questions about the unit or the app, please post in the comments, and I will respond as soon as possible.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Parrot on Patrol", "unixReviewTime": 1392854400, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2014"}

This means that the feeder is pretty heavy and the metal is extraordinarily durable.  In fact, a number of the hoods and perches came knocked out of place during shipping.  (Amazon's usually amazing service for some reason did a lousy job with packing this item for shipment.)  But the perches and hoods were not damaged or bent despite what was probably a turbulent journey and they were easily snapped back into place.  I've only had it for a month, but my guess is that the quality material will probably fare a lot better and longer than my other bird feeder which is mostly made of thin plastic.For what it is primarily designed to do, it does it just fine.  It's easy to fill with bird seed and it attracted a variety of beautiful birds the very first day.However, it is not squirrel proof.I actually filled both feeders and suspended this one from a tree using ametal hookand the other from ashepherd's hook.  I noticed the very first day that half the seed was gone, very quickly.  Suspicious that a squirrel was getting into them, I swapped the two feeders, thinking that perhaps the lack of a plate on the bottom of this Seed Bunker feeder would make it harder for the squirrel to get a grip onto the feeder from the shepherd's hook.  A few hours later, I saw that much of the seed was gone already.  And then an hour after that, I caught the culprit in the act.  The squirrel was able to climb right up the shepherd's crook and then held himself upside down while raiding the Seed Bunker.  It did the exact same thing with the other bird feeder by climbing the tree and scooting himself upside down the metal hook.  At this point, I'm pretty convinced that very little will deter squirrels from the bird feeders, not even those fancy ones which have thecollapsible perches(designed to collapse at the heavy weight of a squirrel, but not a bird) since the squirrel made no use of the perches at all when he was lowering himself onto the feeders from above.It should be noted that Perky Pet does market a number of wild bird feeders that are specifically targeted for problem squirrelshere,here, andhereamong several others, but even those are of limited effectiveness against a determined squirrel.  (Which is what we've got.  Those little buggers have completely chewed through several thick plastic trash can lids of ours.)  Squirrels can chew through plastic parts of so-called squirrel-proof bird feeders.  And even if the feeder is completely made of metal (which this Seed Bunker feeder is not, as the viewing windows are very thin plastic), the squirrels can learn to shake the feeder and spill the seed onto the ground.  There are a fewfeedersthat seem to fare better at warding off squirrels than the ones from Perky-Pet, but they tend to be inthe next price range upand still not 100% effective for everyone.Our current hope, since we don't contemplate spending more money on bird feeders, is that greasing the pole and hook with ample amounts of vaseline will keep the squirrels away and perhaps make for some funny videos if we see them slipping off.  We will see if that does the trick and I'll come back here and update.  I guess, meanwhile, the silver lining in all this is that now that the squirrels have all this bird seed, they're sorta leaving my trash cans alone.  The other silver lining is that my kids have a good reason to scream \"Those Darn Squirrels!\" whenever they see the thieves raiding the feeders.If you found this review helpful or if you have any questions, please let me know.

It's the most attractive, with a glass cylinder and a copper finish on the metal cap and the plastic base surround, with metal flowers surrounding the ports that are protected by what the company identifies as bee guards. We haven't hit the time of year when bees are a problem around our hummingbird feeders, so I can't attest to their effectiveness.The glass cylinder is quite narrow, so it will be difficult to clean without a bottle brush. I also suggest getting a small brush to clean the ports, as they are deep enough that you really want to make sure that they get clean. The base comes apart, so it's easy to clean, but the metal flowers will slow you down a little. It's worth it, though, since they add to the attractiveness of the feeder. I didn't have any trouble with leaking, which was reported in some other reviews.The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder the best as well. Of the three feeders (all cylinder-style), they have been most attracted to this feeder. They do seem to have some problem perching and eating at the same time. It's possible that the bee guards are impeding their ability to get to the juice while sitting on the perches, as they usually hover while feeding.As with the 30-ounce feeder, this feeder came with a packet of nectar concentrate. I recommend tossing it in the garbage, and make a fresh batch of nectar by using four parts boiled water to one part sugar. The packet contains red dye, which the company states is harmless to the birds, but it's not necessary to attract them, so why take the chance?This is a very attractive feeder and would make a great gift.

I prep the mixture in the kitchen after I clean my feeders, then fill the feeder - carrying it upside down until I get in the yard so there is minimal spillage. Even though this one was properly assembled, there was some spilling when I righted it - more than I'm used to in a feeder.

Taking it apart and re-assembling it just once put little clear and red plastic shavings everywhere - including in the nectar reservoir.

I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees.

I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl.

The 3200 model is the premier model in the line of 5 Q series grills, with all the others being a &#34;Tabletop&#34; version. The 3200 is similar to the 2000 versions however it comes with a stand. At first I was a little disappointed that this was plastic. Being used to the build quality of the Genesis series I was surprised.... however it quickly became apparent that my concerns were not warranted and this is a smart design choice by Weber. The use of a heavy duty plastic results in a dramatic reduction in weight without a loss of it feeling solid. I was able to put the unit together in under an hour without any assistance. The documentation is clear and the instructions guided me through to completion without issue. The grill is well designed, as with all Weber grills I have owned or used, the attention to detail shows the quality of this grill. The built in handle light is a nice addition which I had purchased for the genesis, this comes included with the 3200. The side tables fold down and click back together with a substantial lock. The design of the grill plate is clever, the cast porcelain coated plates actually incorporate a flavorizer bar just below the grill bars allowing for a much more compact unit without sacrificing the key functions of the bigger grills in the Weber family.The lid is aluminum coated to reduce the weight of the unit, which can easily be lifted by two people without any strain (one could do it in a pinch). I was able to roll this around with one hand. Ideal for throwing on a truck for tailgating before the game and with the tables folding down the footprint for transporting is not too big. Weber's standard drip tray is also incorporated with the unit meaning standard parts can be purchased for use. There is incorporated holder for the propane tank - electric ignition and dual burners - one outside ring and a central burner from left to right this allows for configuration of indirect heat if required.Again you are getting Weber's quality and from my understanding their warranty service is outstanding - I have never had to utilize it though, their products have served me that well in the past.

Maybe if you have bermuda or some other variety it might do the trick for tiny yards.As a weed whacker, again, I have to say it is so so.

For the first edging of the season, you'll have a really hard time getting a nice clean line with this tool. This tool, while a clever design, is really only suitable for small yards that are consistently maintained.  The only thing I can really say that I like about it, is the edger guide, which goes against the sidewalk to guide not just placement, but also depth, the guide has a little bump out that sits on top of the sidewalk so that you aren't going down too deep and wasting a bunch of trimmer line.I have always like black and decker yard products because they are light enough and sized appropriately for a small woman to do her own yard work - a big plus in my book, and this tool is no exception. However, putting the guard on during first assembly out of the box was unreasonably difficult - I couldn't get it to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed.  I had to wait for my husband to get home and get him to do it.  Big fail.  Why should it  be so difficult to put together that I have to ask my husband for help?Once you get past that difficulty, the rest of this product is dead simple to use and nice and lightweight.

So years ago I switched to a Toro electric blower, which is zero maintenance; but dealing with a 100' cord is a real hassle.  So, when I saw this GreenWorks battery-powered leafblower, I had high hopes, especially since I've been very happy with my GreenWorks G-MAX lawnmower.The blower is great for weekly cleanup.  It's lighter than I expected and produces a very strong air stream -- at least as powerful as my Toro AC powered blower that has the same MPH rating.  The speed control can be easily dialed up and down with your thumb while using the tool, so you can continuously adjust the blower to get just the right force.  Very convenient and easy to use.  I find myself using this blower ten times more often than my old blower, simply because its so simple and convenient.  It takes three seconds (literally) to grab a battery off the shelf, snap it into the blower, and get to work.The only downside of the blower (which almost caused me to drop the rating down to four stars) is that the battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes.  My GreenWorks G-MAX lawn mower runs twice as long on a single battery, so I was expecting better battery life.  The 15-20 minute run time is fine for weekly cleanups, but it means this leafblower won't be able to replace my other leafblower for fall cleanup, when I typically have to run the blower for over an hour to move mountains of fallen leaves.Bottom line:  I really like this blower for weekly cleanup.  It's lightweight, powerful, and super convenient.  It starts instantly and creates no fumes, so I tend to use it a lot more often.  It won't do hour-long leaf clearing sessions in the fall, but it's a great yard tool, especially if you own other GreenWorks G-MAX tools, since the batteries are fully interchangeable.  (Buying into the GreenWorks system of 40V G-MAX lawn tools is sort of like buying into Dewalt 18V tools.  The convenience of interchangeable batteries is huge.

Perky Pet's interactive hummingbird migration map also verified sightings in my area.  After learning this, I started looking at plants for the yard which might help attract hummingbirds and relocated the feeder from a secluded area off the back porch to a more visible spot outside my kitchen window.Even though I've yet to feed a hummingbird, I can't blame the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.  This feeder is simple to clean, fill, and maintain, not to mention easy on the eyes.  If you're looking for a stylish hummingbird feeder, I highly recommend the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.PROS:Simple to clean and fillBee guards protect nectar from bees and wasps12 month limited warrantyCONS:None I could find", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Stylish Simplicity: A Perky-Pet 710B Elegant Copper Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar Review", "unixReviewTime": 1401408000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2014"}

It works great - I can pick it up, extend to the areas I need to water, and then it all very neatly and tightly coils back together near my spigot.  I think the straight ends are KEY as the other coil hoses I've had didn't have this.  As some of the other reviewers noted, you cannot cover anywhere near 50' of distance with this hose due to the coils and the inability to stretch the hose out flat.  Mine works optimally in a 15-25' range and after that I need to hold one side of it with tension to allow the hose to stretch more, maybe to around 35' of range.  I'm very careful not to stretch the coils more than they are intended because when you do that, they can reverse on themselves and it makes untangling the hose a nightmare.  I'll update this review when the hose fails so if there's no additional note, it's still going strong!UPDATE:  4 months in and this hose is still going strong.

In about 4\" of snow, the snowblower did well. It got right down to the asphalt in my driveway, and concrete sidewalk. It's not nearly as loud as my neighbor's Toro snow shovel, so I don't imagine that I annoyed anyone using this in the morning, either. Installation was a piece of cake, and I used Loctite Blue on some of the screws, after reading previous reviews, so that I didn't have any issues with anything coming loose. On top of that, I used WD40 inside the deck, on the auger, and inside the shoot (you MUST let it dry first) - that, too, worked very well.I really only have two issues with this snowblower, and one of them plagues ALL electric snowblowers. First, cable management sucks. This is not a knock on this snowblower, but on all of them. Dragging around a 15lb., 100' 12/3 cable can be a real PITA, and does make clearing snow take a little longer. Still beats the hell out of shoveling, though. Secondly, the chute doesn't always stay where you aim it. I had to turn it a few times after the snow started hitting it so hard that it would spin and throw snow in a different direction. This is the only reason I'm giving this snowblower 4 stars instead of 5, and for the price that I paid, I may even be a little harsh in doing so. I'll likely come up with some solution to both issues, but the second one really should come from the factory.I'll likely update this review once we get more snow to see how things go, but once you get the hang of how you're going to attack your snow removal, things become easier (i.e., cable management). It's easy to see why this is the #1 rated electric snowblower on Amazon.-----------------------------------------------Update: 2/4/14-----------------------------------------------Our area was hit with 10-12\" of some of the heaviest, wettest snow I've ever dealt with, so I figured this was a great test for the snowblower. The snowblower handled most of the snow very well, and the only real time I had some issues, where I had to go over the same spot twice, was where my wife had previously driven over the snow and compacted it down. Still, I was able to clear everything down to the asphalt without much physical effort.I am still very impressed by how well this is handling a wide range of snow types. For those complaining about the snowblower not throwing the snow very far, that's going to happen if you're only trying to remove 2-3\" of snow. The more snow you go through, the farther it's going to be thrown. This happens to all snowblowers, regardless of their powertrain (happened on our old neighborhood's $3k Honda, too).The chute issue does add some time to snow removal, since I have to constantly adjust it. I tried using a long velcro tie to keep it locked, but it was difficult to do quickly while wearing winter gloves. I'm not sure why I didn't think of it sooner, but I'm going to try using a very short bungee tie to keep it in place. If you attach it just below the chute handle before the rod bend, and attach to the side handlebars, it will keep the chute in place. A minor inconvenience, IMO, given that this steal beats the tar out of shoveling.

They provide nylon lined lock nuts and they are very difficult to turn. You will need a 15/16\" wrench, make that two wrenches because you need to use so much force to thread the nylon lining you have to hold on to the bolt as you twist the nut. Other than that it went smoothly and the tires came inflated.The water supply hose provided is low quality 5/8\" hose and a washer was not included for the end that connects to the hose reel. Fortunately I keep some on hand and did use a washer for that connection.The fitting on the reel the supply hose attaches to was screwed on so tight I had to use a wrench to back it off enough to attach the hose.The hose unwinds and winds easily and the unit is easy to move around. So far no leaks at the connectors.At 30 days I already have a couple spots of rust forming. The paint does not seem like a high quality baked on enamel and the U shaped piece in front of the wheels does not have any type of feet so the metal makes direct contact with the ground. It will likely get scratched up and be another source of rusting.The real test of a hose reel is how it is holding up after a season or two.  I am required to post a review within 30 days so I can only give first impressions and will follow up the review when I have had more time with it. My initial impression is this reel will last about as long as a good quality plastic hose reel (3 years) but it is twice the cost.In comparison; June 2004 I purchased a Rapid Reel two-wheeled all metal hose cart and it is still in service today. No rust, no parts have needed replacing and it came with a high quality 3/4\" water supply hose. It has survived 9 Minnesota winters outside; I just disconnect the hoses and drain the water out.

But read on because I also found a good use for it.First, let me tell you how to prevent squirrels in your feeders 100-percent of the time. I've been feeding birds for decades (I'm not going to say how many decades, lol) and while I have tons of gray squirrels on my property, none of them get to my feeders unless I want them to get there (and I do allow them to get to one of my tray feeders, particularly in cold winters). Squirrels can only jump approximately four vertical feet and a little more than that horizontally. So, if you go to a bird-feeder/wildlife supplies store, or your local home store, and buy a say, 8' of metal piping and plant it in the ground (bird feeder stores, if you have one nearby, have a cool tool for this that makes the job ultra easy), you can place a baffle on the pipe just over four feet off the ground and the squirrels will *not* get past it. Then you can put a double or triple shepherd's hook at the top and hang several feeders. I have a 2' x 2' open tray feeder on another pole filled to the brim and no squirrel has ever feasted there. So what you need is a pole, a baffle and some kind of hooks at the top for hanging feeders: all of this is available in a bird-feeding store (I won't mention the chain name here because Amazon will take it out--but it has \"wild\" in the name). (Squirrels *can* jump downward amazing heights, by the way, so you must be careful not to be under a tree limb--I've seen squirrels drop 20 feet vertically.)As far as this feeder goes. First of all, the dome is great for keeping the birds and seed a bit dryer, but it's not going to deter any squirrels. Five mins after the first squirrel got onto this feeder (and I hung it under a tree limb so that he could get there), he hung by his back paws from the loop and swung himself down. Mission accomplished.Also, the description says this hold 3.5 lbs of seed--hah, in someone's dreams. This hardly holds anything. A half pound if you're lucky. The feeder tray is only 9.5-inches across and less than an inch deep.OK, all of that said, there are uses for this feeder and, as I said, it's a cute feeder, pretty nicely made. As at least one other reviewer stated this make a good thistle (niger) feeder--excellent, in fact (some seed does drip out the drain holes, but that can't be avoided). But small finches do have trouble getting their beaks through the grating, so I removed it. I just fill the tray with thistle and they sit on the edge and it works just fine.In it's own way, I kind of find the feeder useful, now the goldfinches have their own little feeder and since squirrels don't like that type of seed, the barely pay it any mind. This feeder is not what it says it is, it's not a squirrel warrior, but it's kind of pretty and I'm sure you can find uses for it. Ironically, if you took off the dome and got rid of the grid, you could fill it with peanuts and feed the squirrels. Or, if you have fruit-eating birds like Baltimore Orioles, you can place orange sections in it. Nothing beats seeing an Oriole at the feeder! If you want to buy the best bird feeders around, look at Droll Yankee.

But the Yard Butler hose cart was a challenge. It does not have a lot of parts but there are NO instructions, just drawings, which are no help and are even numbered incorrectly should you decide to follow them.The first step is to attach the tires using a very large bolt and lock nuts. Simple, except that I could not tighten the lock nuts and wasn't sure how far in to tighten them even if I could. Leaving them at the point where they reached the plastic resulted in too much wobble. So I had to wait for my husband who is much stronger than me, had the correct, large wrench in his mechanic's toolbox, and knew just how much to tighten the bolts. And it required quite a bit of force to do so.Once we got the wheels installed it was easy going to attach the reel and the handle using a screwdriver. Next problem, the cart didn't roll very well. This is because the pneumatic tires had to be inflated. I think plastic tires would be just as good and not need to have air added periodically, especially after the winter. At the very least they could have shipped them with air. We have an air compressor, but not everyone has a tire pump or compressor.I connected the hose, turned on the water, and no leaks. My 100 foot hose fits on the reel, but there isn't enough room for a second hose. Now that it's assembled and operational, it looks nice and is much sturdier than the old plastic cart it replaced.

I've been using this product for so long I can't count the years.  When this one arrived, I compared it to the older two spray nozzles (which still work after a LOT of use):  This is the same as what I bought last year--not a single difference that I can see.  Does the fertilizer do its job?  Oh, my, yes!  And I surely wouldn't be a long-time user and supporter of this Miracle-Gro fertilizer if it didn't give me great results.Plus, it is so easy to use and convenient!  I use the general purpose for all the flowers, green plants and herbs.  Then I switch out the all-purpose bottle with the bottle developed specifically for vegetables for the veggie gardens.  For my very delicate maidenhair ferns and my non-flowering orchids, I screw the spoon attachment onto the (all-purpose) bottle instead of the nozzle and I use a weaker solution in a watering can.  (You squirt fertilizer from the bottle into the attached spoon (it has measurement lines), tip the spoonful into your watering can and go again.)Now, if you have a many-years-old model, there are differences; or if you've never used this product before, here's the scoop:  There are four spray configurations from which to choose; the turn knob at the top (for plain water / off / water-fertilizer mix) is easier to get a grip on and easier to turn; the handle is ergonomically correct, with on / off button easy to manipulate.  The bottle of liquid fertilizer (comes with one bottle) screws into the yellow end, so the nozzle as a whole looks a bit odd, but it is trying to do a balancing act with the bottle of fertilizer.Regarding the four spray choices:  The \"shower\" gives a good, general coverage--not too wide, not too heavy/harsh.  The \"flat\" works very well for me when it is very windy, or when I have plants close together in a line.  The \"stream\" is the configuration with all the tiny holes in the round; it also works for me when it is windy, or when I want to reach plants further away, as it is a more forceful spray.  The other one is \"jet\", and I don't use that much at all, because it really disturbs the soil around the base of the plant and is forceful enough to make a mess of flower petals.  But I suppose the jet spray is good for shooting into a container.If you've not used this product before, you should check on the price of replacement feeder bottles to see if it is in line with your budget:  You do pay for convenience!  If you've got a good-sized garden, you will go through many bottles of this fertilizer if you fertilize as often as the directions recommend.  I fertilize about once every two weeks.  So, once every two weeks, I switch out the nozzle heads on my hose and use this, then I water and fertilize at the same time.  Whalla!  And done!(I have tried to use this nozzle as my everyday nozzle, (because you can turn the knob on top to water only) but I think it is a bit too heavy and cumbersome for constant use.)One tip:  After fertilizing, switch the knob to water only and spray for a short minute to clear the insides of fertilizer solution, in an effort to prevent corrosion.  Happy gardening!This kit comes in a plastic \"stand\", with a hole for one bottle, the spoon and the nozzle.  I think it is a waste of plastic, and I don't think it adds value to the product.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Same feeder spray nozzle as last year; solution works wonders!", "unixReviewTime": 1393632000, "reviewTime": "03 1, 2014"}

This plate offers a lot of welcome protection for your hand, although I advise always wearing a thick leather glove when near any trapped animal.Depending upon what size creature you're trying to trap, you'll need to experiment with bait and whether or not to use one or two open doors. The mechanism for shutting the doors depends upon the animal depressing the center trip plate enough. Lighter animals may be able to get the bait without activating the trap. I advise using a big gob of peanut butter with some cereal or nuts or kibble smushed down into the peanut butter. It adds more weight and makes the creature work at it to get the nuts or cereal or kibble. You can also embed a metal nut in the peanut butter to add even more weight, if necessary.Also, if you find the bait has been taken but the trap didn't close, try using only one door open. You can easily do this by disengaging the second door cable from the setting loop.This trap does work for smaller animals but expect to experiment a little to trap your little pests. Also, be sure to check your trap at least twice a day because a small animal can dehydrate quickly in the trap, especially if it is frantically trying to get out. Releasing the animal safely is the whole reason for live traps anyway, right? So part of using these traps humanely is checking them often.When you do trap an animal, have an old towel or cloth ready to cover the cage before transporting it to a release area. The covering calms the animal down. When you reach the release area, place the trap on the ground and quietly open the trap. Move away from the trap until the animal has left and then retrieve your trap.Sometimes sharing space with small creatures causes big problems. This trap makes it easier to humanely relocate a problem animal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Live Trap for small creatures", "unixReviewTime": 1403049600, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2014"}

King", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "In the spring small squirrels abound near my bird feeders, but this trap hasn't caught any.  My other Havahart trap catches many, but this one is too small and the two door thing doesn't help.  If you're trying to catch smaller critters, the easy set feature is really nice and the trap may work great, but was a failure for my intended purpose.The trap I received was a little different from the one pictured, so it might have been just a fluke that when I tried the one door method the trigger panel on the bottom was facing the wrong way.  There is a large hook on the top of the trap that holds one of the setting wires.  When you disengage that wire from the hook, the door to which the wire is attached stays closed when you set the trap.  The other wire is connected directly to the other door mechanism and can't be released.I tried the trap with both doors open first and didn't catch any critters even though the trap was sprung.  The directions say that if that happens, set it with only one door open, so I released the door wire from the top hook.  Didn't  make sense to me as the squirrel would trigger the panel before it was fully in the cage.  After multiple days, no squirrels were caught by this method nor was the trap sprung, so I decided to cut the wire to the door I thought should be the one left open (per the picture and common sense).  No takers that way either.It is hard to drop bait into the trap with only one door open because of the slant of the closed door and the fact that it's a solid panel, so I finally gave up on this trap and returned to the regular Havahart squirrel sized trap which is always effective.  It is harder to set, but more sensitive and snaps shut faster which is a requirement for squirrels.  Because it is larger, if a big squirrel comes by he will be caught just like a small squirrel, rather than springing the trap and getting away.I hoped this trap would be sturdier because eventually the other trap gets bent and won't set anymore so I have to replace it.  This one is sturdier, but since it's not effective for my needs, that doesn't help me.  I plan to put it in the barn as see if it catches mice, but will return to my regular method for squirrels.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not for squirrels, even small ones", "unixReviewTime": 1399680000, "reviewTime": "05 10, 2014"}

He/She tripped my wooden traps, yet escaped harm; managed to find my sticky traps and left behind fuzz and hair as proof that it yet again escaped.

I placed one of the1 Pack Dispos Bait Stationunderneath the Kitchen sink.  This was the one place that I could check daily for evidence of mice.  The mouse took the bait, literally, and I have not seen it or any other signs of re-infestation since.4 Pack Dispos Bait Stationworks just as well as the refillable.  I prefer refillable as it's more economical and I have no where to recycle the type plastic the disposable stations are made of.  In order to refill you simply turn the unit over exposing the side that sits flat on the floor.  You have to hold back on a clear plastic tab with one hand and push two additional tabs towards each other and then pull out the square tube that holds the bait, replace bait and slide the tube back into the station.The package claims these are child and pet resistant.

I went out on the deck last night and heard unusual noise; sure enough, the local gimpy raccoon (has a bum leg) was tossing & turning the feeder.
