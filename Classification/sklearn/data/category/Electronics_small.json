Typically I'd use my old Garmin GPS with its LCD screen and AA batteries for my navigation.  However, with some of the excellent hiking apps out there, I've found myself relying more on my iPhone for navigation duty, and it works well with some significant advantages over my 15 year old Garmin.  Thing is, those iPhones run through their batteries like crazy.Then this device hit my radar and I'm very glad it did.  The footprint on this isn't so large that making room for it in my ruck is a hassle, and it really is slim - the size of a small paperback book.  It does have some weight to it (which is a welcome thing, I think...beware of manufacturers claiming outrageous capacities that are really light) so you'll notice it in your pack.  But for multiday hikes it's just perfect for when you find yourself away from Normal and need to charge your device.I'm able to get 9-10 iPhone charges out of it before it runs out of power, so for those long hikes I think the sheer power capacity justifies the weight.  I won't rehash the technicals that other reviewers have gone through.  I'll just say that this device offers serious value and advantages for the money.  It's well built and solid.  If you and your hiking buddies have need for remote charging of devices far away from any power outlet, this is the item to buy.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An outstanding product", "unixReviewTime": 1405382400, "reviewTime": "07 15, 2014"}

For one thing they are super comfortable. For another the sound is incredible. In fact I have been testing various phones - mainly from this brand, but also some Sennheiser models - and this is head and shoulders above the pack.I'll be honest and disclose that comfort edges out sound when phones sound good enough. I will normally not quibble over a few hundred Hz one way or the other as long as I can wear the phones without noticing them. These are not only unobtrusive, but downright comfortable, which is a major reason why these have now replaced my trustyBrainwavz HM9 Hi-Fi Noise Isolating Headphones.Soundwise the specs do not begin to describe the richness, especially bass. In fact, when I read the 20 Hz to 20 MHz range I thought that the sound would be somewhat generic for phones in this range. I own a pair of IEMs (in-ear monitors) that go as low as 18 Hz at the same 95dB at 1mW sensitivity, yet these sound much deeper than those. I love the balance of sound across the frequency spectrum as though it's on a smooth continuum. Every one of my test albums I played through these phones sounded so good that I decided that it's time to hang up the headphones and go with these.Part of the reason why I love these from a comfort perspective is the over the ear memory wire. I prefer that style, but not everyone does. They are definitely stiff and take on a shape that will be uniquely yours over time (and a very short time at that!) Also, while this ships with aBrainwavz Hard Earphone Casethe phones will not fit after you have contoured them to your ear. The case is useful for carrying around the array of adapters and tips that are included. In fact, the final reason I love these phones is the included triple-flange style silicon tips, which block out the rest of the world and allow me to focus solely on music.If you love music and want to hear every note faithfully reproduced in their natural frequencies these phones are it. I can honestly say that I have not used a better set of phones from any brand in this price range, including some Sennheiser models that have a street price of fifty to seventy-five dollars more than these, so the value is definitely there.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "These won me over", "unixReviewTime": 1395100800, "reviewTime": "03 18, 2014"}

There was all types of crackle on the bass and I had to turn the tv up to 98 when watching movies.In any event this is simply the first part of the review as I have not had the chance to really put the system through it s paces. I just set it up last night and it was too late in the evening to be pumping out loud audio.I mainly wanted to share my initial impressions concerning the build quality and the setup.This is the first set of dedicated home speakers that I have ever purchased so I dont really have a solid frame of reference. Growing up I just used my Phillips home stereo cd/cassette player to output richer sound from my tv.The speakers and sub woofer are made of high grade glossy plastic. I am not mounting the speaker so I cant speak much to that but it certainly appears as though it would be a relatively painless process as they seem to give you everything you would need. I want to say the speakers feel good in your hands and are very dense and weighty . The design on them is striking and overall It really looks like a high quality 2.1 system. I was very impressed. I cant really over state the feel. Not that you will be going up and touching your speakers often but everything from the sat. speaker connectors on the woofer feel very well made. The only exception is the sensor fab. its made of a lower grade of plastic.In any event I had the system up and running in about 20 mins. Would take less time if you have a specific place for your equipment already etched out.So as far as audio I can only say right now that the low volume range is far greater than on my tv. I have a much larger lever of incremental range between no sound and comfortable low sound. Voices came through clear and seemed to be balanced which is a problem I often had with my tv speakers, where the music would overshadow voice overs.Will update when I have time to do better sound tests.Inputs 3.5mm Aux port, Red and white composite in, Digital optical audio port and Bluetooth.Looking forward to testing the Bluetooth playback.

Originally I had 2 of these, each of which was plugged into an ethernet switch, and the whole system, in 2 different rooms, was connected via a \"Powerline\" adapter.  Plugging directly into switches rather than into the router made it so this set up sort of worked most of the time, however there were still quite a lot of issues that I now believe were due to the use of Powerline adapters.  I ultimately had my house wired for ethernet cable, and now that I am no longer using powerline adapters and everything is wired directly, there are almost no issues with this product.  In addition, Silicondust continues to update their firmware and drivers, and I have found that these recent updates since I bought the 2 tuners have made the system much more stable.  Unless you are going to use these with a wired ethernet system I think you could just save yourself a lot of grief and use your cable company's standard DVR boxes and call it a day, since wireless and or bridging adapter technology such as MOCA or Powerline adapters are probably unlikely to give you a satisfactory experience with this Silicondust tuner product.Original Review below:There are hundreds if not thousands of online reviews of this product, many of which go into great detail.  I have owned two of these tuners for about 2 months now.  I have had quite a few issues with \"lost tuner\" type error messages, issues with Windows Media Center, etc., but have worked through most of them and for the most part I get stable performance with these.Don't rely on streaming HD Video throughout your house via wireless; it might happen at least some of the time, but don't count on it.  Wires are your friend :-)  Routers tend to mess up the HD TV signals that come out of these tuners.  If at all possible, invest in a gigabit switch and then plug the tuner and your computer that will be recording shows into the switch, NOT into the router.  In this set up the TV signals will remain in the switch except to the extent that they get broadcast outside of the switch and through the rest of your network.  If you plug this device and your computer's Ethernet cord into the same gigabit switch, the router will not have the opportunity to scramble or screw up the TV signals and you should be able to get good reception and recordings on your TV.  When isolated in a switch, all the router does is to assign an IP address to the traffic, but does not process the intra switch traffic.I am using Windows 7 Media Center.  Like all Microsoft products, it works well except when it doesn't :-)  If your recordings are important to you, then consider REDUNDANCY.  I have two of these SD HD Homerun Primes, in separate rooms, each plugged into gigabit switches, into which are also plugged in the TVs that are used for viewing and recording the programs.  Each computer independently records each of the programs I want to record.  That way, if one of the systems fails, the other one almost always gets the program recorded and you can transfer the missed programs to the other one on a portable hard disk or USB drive.  In my particular case, the connection between the router and the \"second independent system plugged into a gigabit switch\" is a set of powerline adapters, however you could do this in any of several ways to connect the two systems (Cat 5e or 6 cable would be best but is not an easy option in my house).  With this sort of hardware (and software, especially if Microshaft is involved) redundancy is your friend.My only caution would be that these things likely will require some technical capabilities and a lot of patience on your part to get installed and running reliably.  If you are not a technically oriented person, and if you can't deal with frustration, LOTS of frustration, do yourself a favor and have your Cable Guy install whatever system the cable provider is hawking at the moment.  You'll sleep better.Good luck.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Some operational issues but would not go back", "unixReviewTime": 1391558400, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2014"}

The replacement unit addressed the port sizing issues described below and I've had no issues with any USB devices not fitting into any of the hub's ports. Great customer service and the replacement product works as advertised.  I'd certainly recommend this product (and more importantly, this company) to anyone.  It also goes to show the importance of honestly reviewing products you purchase online.  You might be pleasantly surprised by the experience.ORIGINAL REVIEW (3/5 stars): I picked this up because my new laptop only has 2 USB ports and I was consuming both of them between my mouse's receiver and my required GbE dongle... this does what it purports and turns 1 port into 4, but I have issues with some USB devices even fitting into the ports (my mouse's receiver was one. I've had 2 or 3 USB thumb drives that were difficult to insert).  After fiddling a bit, I was able to get the thumb drives inserted, but the mouse receiver is still a no-go.

The Pentax K100D camera is a very basic camera that is best for people new to DSLR photography.  The Pentax K100D camera is simple to use since it kacjs the more complex features of higher end DSLRS.  I would not pay more than $250 dollars for a very good condition Pentax K100D camera  unless you must have one in new condition.  I was able to get some really great very good condition Pentax K100D camera's for about $200 each total with shipping.  I brought 3 of the Pentax K100D camera model.  I love that this camera takes standard AA batteries.  One reviewer states the AA batteries did not last. I took over 200 pictures out and about in my home town Towson, Maryland and never changed the baterries. I took more than 75 flash pictures in my house without needing to change batteries.  I just used Duracell's.  I have rechargable AA batteries I just have not started using them in my Pentax K100D camera.The pictures right out of the camera are awesome.  I shoot in raw format, keeping the RAW file and converting copies of the raw file to JPG or TIFF images for common production use. The camera has no video feature but I neither want or miss it. I have a dedicated video camera for making quality video movies. The Pentax K100D camera  accepts the standard K Pentax lenses.  The Pentax K100D camera is a stubby little camera great for a person like me with small hands. My big 6 ft 8 in 298 pound brother has hands the size of baseball mitts but he can navigate this camera's controls with only slight issues.I have found this Pentax K100D camera  to be a great beginners camera and a great backup camera.  I have a Pentax K30 and a Pentax K5 but I am not yet a true photographer. I am still learning my hobby of photography. When I am good enough to leave auto focus for good and have some camera skills I will move up to my K5.  While I am still learning my DSLR basics the Pentax K100D camera  gives me the freedom to learn, make mistakes and recover quickly. I do better with learning when I do not fear making a mistake. The Pentax K100D camera is a cheap basic DSLR that takes great pictures while teaching you DSLR basics.The Pentax K100D camera has only six megapixels, 6 MP which is more than enough for my picture taking needs since I will never produce images over 8\" x 10\".  If I ever need poster sized prints I'll haul out my Pentax K5 and shoot till I get what I want. This is a great camera even in the aftersale \\ used marketplace.

This does have a negative but it doesn't bother me.  Since I had so many plugs on 1 unit that I wanted to stay on on the time and so many that I wanted to shut off on my other unit I had to add power strips in to connect everything to the type of plug I wanted.  Also keep in mind this isn't meant to keep your devices on for long periods of time.  It is meant to give you time to shut everything off.  At about half draw (400 watts) I get about 10 minutes.

I'll just copy and paste the review I did for theGE 24792 Compact Attic Mount Antenna with Mount:-------------------------------------------\" I'm amazed by this little GE antenna. Before carrying it to the attic, I wanted to see if it would perform next to my TV's with a 3 foot cable and no preamp. On one TV I got around 35% signal strength on 4 of 5 UHF stations that are about 57 miles away (a couple are 22-27 miles). This was in the center of my house, 8 ft off the ground (crawlspace + my height). The signal was beaming through a bedroom, so at least two walls to get to the outside. Also, I'm aiming through trees (tall oaks, trunks only) and hilly terrain.  I'm going to compare this antenna to (1) a 15 year old 8 bay with 300ohm connector and a 15 year old channel master preamp, (2) a Channel Master CM-4228 antenna and Channel Master CM-7778 preamp, (3) G.E. Attic antenna and Channel Master CM-7778 preamp. All three antennae were tested in the same location in my attic. There was really not a lot of difference in signal strength between the three setups. The GE actually got slightly better performance overall, raising the signal strength 5 points on a couple of channels.In my attic, I'm aiming through the roof, of course. The line of sight is obstructed, again, by the trunks of about six very tall trees, all within 250 feet, with the nearest two being about 50 feet. I mounted the GE at the very top of the roofline rafter. This places the antenna about 25-30 feet above ground level. Here is the signal strength I'm getting on 7 primary channels I can receive using the GE antenna. The mileage is calculated by TVFOOLS.COM. Note that the stations 57 miles away have their tower based on top of a 1,621 foot mountain. My antennae is pointing at 102 degrees. I had a TV close by that I could view from the attic. Cable length was about 35 feetChannel A: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 90Channel B: 57.5 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 84Channel C: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 83Channel D: 57.6 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 78Channel E: 57.3 miles, 102 degrees, Signal Strength: 85Channel F: 22.5 miles, 74 degrees , Signal Strength: 83Channel G: 27.6 miles, 213 degrees, Signal Strength: 71Once I connected my two way splitter and moved the test TV back to the bedroom, I lost about 10 pts of signal on each station, but the picture is still perfect with no pixelation. My TV locations require about 50ft and 75ft of cable from the TV to the antenna. In total, I get about 15 digital channels, with 7 of those being the primary channel.It takes a few minutes to assembly and you have to be careful. The mounting hardware allows you to place the antenna just about anywhere. I have it mounted, hanging down from an angled rafter. TV signals can be strange, so your mileage may vary with any antenna. If you can't get a signal, no antenna in the world is going to help. \"---------------------------------------------Unfortunately, I had to take a loss shipping this Channel Master back to Amazon ( I kept the preamp).

I had the entire scale wrong from looking at the pictures.

What happened is I received the card and immediately threw it in the camera and shot a few pics.  It came formatted so that was not an issue.  Then, I read the most popular review for it on here and saw the notes about how you don't achieve ideal performance until you run a Transcend AutoFormat utility pass over it to re-format the card in complete (slow) mode and then re-do a quick format from the camera.So that's what I started out trying to do.  Downloaded the AutoFormat utility, began the format process, but it hung at 46.55% and went no further.  Quit, tried again, same point it hangs.  I tried formatting from Windows 7 itself, that ultimately hung and failed after a few hours, same behavior on my MacBook Pro.  I tried AutoFormat once more and this time it produced an actual fail message.  I'm guessing there are some bad memory cells in the card I received.In any case, the purpose of my review is primarily to let you know that with a 64 GB card, that you only quick format, or perhaps just use right out of the box, you may shoot for a while before running into any bad portions and if you reach that point and the filesystem on the card becomes corrupt, you could lose your pictures.  I'd recommend using the AutoFormat utility on any new card just to be sure it can complete the entire pass before you put the card into use.I got a second one from Amazon, no hassle exchange, ran AutoFormat slow mode with zero errors, did quick format in the Canon 5D Mark III, no errors, and have shot on it until full with no issues.  I quick format it frequently in the camera after I've transferred images off and have yet to encounter any errors, so I think I just got a bad card, but I still strongly recommend you AutoFormat slow first to ensure your card is 100%.  Transfers on/off are very fast if you have a USB3 card reader.

Hearing the other caller was clear and they did not have any complaints over my voice quality until the in-line controller rolled over. I love how they made the controller closer to the face instead of way down the cord. This means the microphone for the phone is actually near my mouth.  They were missing a clip to hold it at the right angle though. You can also use the in-line controller to pick up and disconnect from calls.The packaging itself was a little overkill to be honest. They could reduce that down a bunch. It is like they tried to make it stand out on the gaming shelves (they have many headsets in that area) or against other headsets.Overall, a recommended product with good sound, good pricing, audio controls and double use as a phone headset for iOS devices.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Ok, I was impressed", "unixReviewTime": 1403740800, "reviewTime": "06 26, 2014"}

I have a Dell Windows laptop that's has incredible specs; however, I don't find myself ever using it to its maximum capabilities. So why should I drag around 6.5 lbs with me all day? The Acer C720 is incredibly light and it's much thinner than it appears in the pictures. The build is very nice for a $199 laptop. It uses a sturdy matte colored plastic which I actually find rather attractive. It doesn't look toy-like.The screen is something that many people have complained about but I find it perfectly satisfactory. The resolution is good enough for the size of the screen and it's plenty bright to be used in sunlight especially since it's a matte display. The keyboard is nicely spaced and the keys feel okay at best. The keys are very shallow which I don't particularly like but I can understand why they had to do that. It takes a little bit of time to get used to but after a day's use, the keyboard should feel fine. My WPM fell about 10 from my average 85-90 WPM on a desktop keyboard but after several days, I'm starting to get back up to that range. The trackpad is really nice. It has a nice smooth texture and it's responsive. I don't know what some of the other review have been saying about it being loose. Mine is definitely sturdy. It does make a loud click but if you turn on &#34;tap to click&#34; you'll only actually have to make a loud click when you have to grab and drag something.I bought this laptop to primarily use out and about for work so it was very important for me to have it open my PDFs. I put my PDF files on the 16gb hard drive and they open right up with the Chrome PDF viewer. Perfect! All of my documents, music, and photos were already in the Google cloud so as soon as I turned the laptop on, everything was ready to be viewed.The battery is rather amazing as well considering how light this laptop is. The machine came with no power. Once I plugged it in, it took just over an hour to charge. On my first charge, I've managed to get just under 9 hours! Wow! My usage was pretty light though. Primarily opening up books, reading news, typing two emails, and watching a couple of youtube videos. Still, that's an awesome battery life.In terms of Chrome OS, I think it has a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality. Sure, it can't run Photoshop or autoCAD, but I think the majority of people don't use those programs. I, personally, don't need anything more than what Chrome OS offers. If you really need some kind of editing tool, the Chrome Store has replacement apps that can get the job done. You just have to look for those apps or just Google search for them.Speed on this little guy is incredible! I can't believe that a $199 machine can work this quickly. Pages load up almost instantly and that includes videos. In terms of browser performance, the Acer beats my Windows laptop (which has a Core i7, 8gb ram, and a SSD). I don't know how Google accomplished this but it's truly incredible. I think the 4gb model is overkill. This 2gb model has not slowed on me. I use a max of about 10 tabs. The laptop never lags or skips a beat with that many open. I personally don't use more than that at any one time; however, I've heard that this thing can handle up to 20 tabs without slowing down. I can't imagine how many you'd need to open for the 4gb model to slow down.In general, this is a 5 star machine.

They're durable (very) and nice looking. The ear cushions are very comfortable, and for me, I can get a very good fit that remains comfortable for hours (I wear these for long as hell high school swim meets). The highs and mids are both good, especially compared to their SOL counterparts, and I feel they easily beat all those \"mainstream headphones\" out there: Beats, Monster DNAs, Soul,  Steet and Skullcandies. The bass is the strongest part, with equal emphasis on boom and tight thuds. We all know Beats and co, for instance, also have beefed up bass, so the reason SOL is better is actually because their MIDS are very competent. These cans are very capable of playing rock and metal (some examples of those two would be Shinedown, Breaking Benjamin, In Flames, and Soilwork). There is a sound separation I can note too, I feel like I can tell the various instrumentals apart. I dont want anyone comparing these to $300 Shures, of AKGS, or Sennheisers, because that's not they are for. On the other hand, I actually wasn't at all impressed by the $150 sennhesiers at Best Buy.Overall, these are well worth the money, and you can get them a little cheaper through Amazon. I would recommend testing the fit at a local store though, because the very nice headphone has a drawback: you cant adjust the angle the cans go on your ear, so people with stick-out ears may have a bigger issue. They work great for me, and my biggest criticism is the sound isolation is only average. There are a few cracks in the fit, which probably goes for everyone. Otherwise, they are stellar, and I have no problems with that single drawback.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "As good as casual headphones can be", "unixReviewTime": 1390953600, "reviewTime": "01 29, 2014"}

I figured the OEM speakers could just handle the mid-bass and treble. The salesman thought I was crazy, but he and I liked the sound after installing the Bazooka. At the time, the salesman at the stereo shop talked me out of changing out the 4 OEM speakers, and I went with it. Never turned the bass on the head over 25% and adjusted the Bazooka accordingly. Over time I realized the treble had become a little harsh, but I lived with it. Truck got broken into in around 2008, all they took was the Bazooka tube. They would've stole the head had I replaced it...learned that from a prior vehicle...don't replace the stereo, it invites thieves. Insurance company actually replaced the sub with a 250w Bazooka...more power!Now, many years later, 2014, I can tell that I blew at least the front passenger speaker, so time to swap em all out. Thought about a new head unit, but decided to try new speakers with the OEM head first. Picked up a pair of Polk Audio DB651 for the front doors, and a pair of these DB461P for the rear extended cab doors. Wow!!! I had almost never heard any sound coming out of my rear speakers til I installed these. Great highs and mids, and handle a lot more bass than the OEM's ever did. Now I run the OEM head at about 50% bass so I get more mid bass, still letting the Bazooka handle the low bass duties. These speakers all handle max volume of the head while remaining perfectly clear, listening to the heaviest of metal!!Installation was not all that difficult, had to remove all the door panels, plenty of YouTube vids explaining how to do that. Grabbed some of the Metra 72-4568 Speaker Harnesses for $6 a pair making the connections simple. Had to drill in to the inner steel of the door to mount them.

Jentsch", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "The first thing you'll notice about this keyboard cover is how nice the keyboard keys feel to the touch. I expected a compromised keyboard that had to sacrifice construction quality and key response in order to be light enough to serve as a cover for the iPad Air without adding so much to the bulk of the tablet as to make it something you wouldn't want to use very often.I was very wrong. I own a few other Logitech keyboards and this one can hold its own with them any day of the week.During use, the tablet rests comfortably in the slot, holding the tablet at a good angle for visibility. Tapping on the keys will not dislodge the iPad Air from that slot, which is a very good thing, as you really don't want an expensive tablet falling down and then bouncing from the table to the floor.Not only do you have a very nice Bluetooth keyboard, it also functions as a cover to protect the screen of the iPad Air. The tablet snaps into place quite well, and the weight and/or bulk that it adds does not make you wish that it was thinner or lighter.The only complaints that I had while using it leading up to this review are some quirks with the keystrokes and scrolling using the arrow keys. Copying and pasting with a keyboard is a lot easier than using your finger (in my opinion), so this was a joy to try out the first time.What I didn't expect was that the keystrokes for copy and paste do not mimic Windows, but rather the Mac. I guess that makes sense, given that the iPad is a cousin to the Mac, but would it have been so wrong to enable CTRL-C and CTRL-V as well as CMD-C and CMD-V? It didn't take me long to figure out what I was doing wrong, but others might not have experience with the Mac keystrokes and will end up confused. Even a note in the box mentioning it would have been a welcome touch.While in Safari, I expected the arrow keys to function like I am accustomed to them functioning in my web browsers on the desktop. I use my up and down arrow keys to scroll a page while I read (or the mouse scroll wheel, but no such thing on this keyboard), and I was surprised when hitting the down arrow key didn't scroll the document I was reading (maybe it's not the Mac way?).Aside from those two very minor issues, I can't think of anything wrong with this product. The price is a little high, but street prices fluctuate, so if that's a concern, keep an eye out for sales and price reductions and jump when you're comfortable.One side note, while I did the testing of fit and function with an iPad Air, I also tried out an iPad 4 to see if it would work. Electronically, it worked like a champ, which I expected it to. Unfortunately, the physical slot that holds the iPad is not made for the iPad 4, so while it will hold the tablet initially, it will not stay there, and you'll find yourself catching the tablet as it starts to lose its place and before it smacks the table or demonstrates the laws of gravity for you.I think you'll like this item, both as a keyboard and as a protective cover!

There are versions of this case with a 300 Watt PSU.Some considerations:(1) If you choose memory that has a heat spreader, try and go for one that is low profile or does not protrude vertically that much as it can interfere with the optical drive.(2) If you install an optical drive, try & find one that has the shortest depth to offer you the greatest margin between any component below it.(3) You can install 2 hard drives under the optical drive, one 3.5 inch and one 2.5 inch but be mindful that the PSU is rated at 200 Watts and a version of this case with a 300 Watt PSU is also available.(4) This case is available with a 300 Watt PSU with either front USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 ports.(5) Being a tiny case there is not much that you can do in the way of cable management. I ran the HDD cables under the HDD. I used Velcro tie strips in several places to gather the various cables into a harness of sorts.(6) I replaced the only fan with an Enermax UC-8EB fan which is very quiet and easy to clean.(7) The Blue LED on the front is bright. You're either going to like it or not like it.(8) If you're looking for front USB 3.0 ports, this is not the case for you (look for the BP655.300BL & check with the seller since some sellers are taking this case & just upgrading the PSU. The ports on the front should be blue for USB 3.0(9) There is no chassis speaker. The motherboard that I used had a 4-pin speaker header and I was able to purchase a small 2-wire speaker on a 4-pin header for a couple of bucks. The speaker is mostly for POST errors.I built two nearly identical systems using the MSI FM2-75IA-E53 motherboard which has rear USB 3.0 ports as well as built-in Wi-Fi.

Both have similiar image quality and impossible to tell apart. Some said, the D7100's high ISO performance isn't that great vs the D5100. It's actually slightly better, but not by much according to my tests. Keep in mind you're viewing a 24mp vs 16mp too.Tested the D610 before making my choice to go with the D7100. The D610 isn't a  bad camera, but can't stand all the focus points cluttered into a tight space. The D7100 also seem to focus faster too with the same lens (50mm F/1.8).  If i were to go full frame, i would skip directly to the D800's. Personally I think the D7100 is better than the D610 and D700.

{"reviewerID": "A1TNW9CI3E6EX7", "asin": "B00HNFPZF0", "reviewerName": "BigPhotoShow", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "POSITIVES:This protective case is amazing. The case literally makes my ipad air feel like it is completely protected. What I especially love is the fact that the case also covers your SCREEN (plastic shield).  So, I will NEVER scratch my ipad screen. I was surprised at how response the plastic cover over the ipad air screen would be. I had been buying the cheap plastic covers to go on my screen, but I do not need to do that with this case. It truly does protect every single side of my ipad air.The handle on the back is great! I first thought to myself, \"boy, this handle looks stupid. What is it for?\" But, after using my ipad air to read kindle and other electronic books, I can say that having the handle on my hand allows me to REST so my the strain of holding my ipad is gone! The fact that I can rotate the handle is perfect for folks who read electronic books.I'm also a speed walker. I walked 30 minutes fast pace with nothing but my hand in the handle of the ipad case and my ipad did not fall, nor did I even think it would fall. It truly makes the ipad feel secure.NEGATIVES:Because the case surrounds the bezel, it is almost impossible to relocate icons in landscape view. Go ahead. Try it! Hold down one of your icons in landscape view to the point where all of the icons shake, which signals that you can now move them on different screens... Now, try to move one icon on one screen to another screen in landscape mode/view. You can't because the trent case covers up so much of your ipad's bezel that you have to rotate your ipad air back into portrait view to move your icons to other screens. Maybe it's just MY case.  But, I cannot do it in landscape view at all!The instructions should be in color or should be a photo of the actual case. I first had the hardest time getting the case open to place my ipad in it because I couldn't figure out where along the edges, I was suppose to open the case.  I kept pulling and pulling and then thinking, maybe this isn't the right spot because the case won't open.  I wish I could see a better image on the instruction sheet.  It turns out it was the right spot, but the case is a bear to open up!  You will think you're going to break it to get it open.  Perhaps the areas to open the case should have been a different color, rather than the same color as the case.  Additionally, once I finally got the case open and placed my ipad air in it and snapped it back shut, I then read the NEXT line of instructions. The next line talked about how I could adjust the strap for my hand.Well, guess what? The strap was too large for my hand, so I had to RE-OPEN the case and REMOVE my ipad air. Then, because the straps are so secure on the little screws to adjust it, I had to use a great deal of strenght to remove the strap to tighten it up. I felt like I was going ot break the strap. By the time I repositioned the strap and placed my ipad air back in the case, I had several finger prints and smudges INSIDE the case and on my ipad, so I had to clean it with a soft rag before placing it back in the case again.I guess my point is, the instructions for adjusting the hand strap should be the FIRST thing mentioned. Otherwise, you're going to have folks placing their ipad in the case, securing it and THEN reading about adjusting the strap and they will have to RE-OPEN  the case all over again. The strap is automatically adjusted for the largest hands. Why? Perhaps it should be adjusted just one notch down for those who have average sized hands.It's because of these two issues that I reduced it to 4 stars, rather than rate it at 5.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "This baby TRULY protects your ipad.

{"reviewerID": "AB91W3ZUSW397", "asin": "B00FRDUZXM", "reviewerName": "doublemeat", "helpful": [2, 4], "reviewText": "PROS- Amazing photos! Of course. You already knew this. The shallow depth-of-field you can get with this is amazing, with the full-frame sensor, at maximum aperture. (Well technically, the sensor doesn't produce shallow depth of field, the lens focal length does. And at the same distance and framing, a larger sensor requires a longer focal length [shorter depth-of-field] than a smaller one. It's all interrelated.)- Love all the customizable buttons.- I can't get over the size of this thing. It's so small (yet useable). If you were to remove the battery grip, the swivel mechanism for the LCD monitor, and the viewfinder - this thing would fit in any pocket. (Well minus the lens.)- Multiple pro photography websites call this sensor the best currently in the world, or very close to it. The 55mm f/1.8 prime lens has been tested as the second-best lens ever tested by some magazine. (Behind a Leica lens.)- The idea of apps is pretty cool.- It has a really cool single-shot HDR-like feature (forgetting the name). Basically it takes a darker image than you chose, then brings up the shadows while leaving the highlights the same. I've used this exact same method for over a decade - I adjust exposure compensation down a couple of clicks, then bring the shadows up in post. This helps prevent blown-out highlights, and assuming your ISO is low enough, doesn't increase shadow noise much (because the camera can choose a lower ISO than you would use otherwise). The only drawback is that if you dial this effect up too much, the images look a little flat. There isn't as much contrast to pop. And there seems to be a slight &#34;HDR&#34;-ish local contrast effect. Not as obvious as HDR mode, but it I think it's there.- Focus peaking feature is awesome, even in the mostly auto-focus mode that also uses it.- Manual focusing is easy with automatic &#34;pixel zoom&#34; and focus peaking.- The continuous focus mode is really cool. You can focus and recompose, and watch the focus box follow what you originally focused on. (How do they do that! That's like machine vision. In a camera.)PSEUDO-CONS- Viewfinder isn't very good. Not high-res enough. But...what do you expect? You are buying a mirrorless camera! It's not an SLR.- The kit lens isn't amazing. Better than I feared, worse than I hoped. Will definitely invest in a more expensive lens.- The HDR feature does too much &#34;local contrast&#34; and looks too flat/&#34;HDR-ey&#34;. It would have been nice if there were a menu option letting you specify how to present the dynamic range. Specifically, instead of contrast masking with overdone local contrast, I'd rather it collapsed the dynamic range. And better yet, collapsed the dynamic range with more than 8 bits per color of JPEG; i.e., collapsed dynamic range with 16 bits-per-color raw. (Or even the native 14 bpc. You might think that 14 bpc only contains 75% more data than 8 bpc. You'd be wrong, it's actually 6,400% times more information.) But, sometimes it works pretty well.- Why doesn't focus peaking work in full auto-focus mode? It would be really nice to see what the autofocuser has decided will be in focus, above and beyond the crude green brackets/squares.CONS (-1 star for these)- Startup is too slow. Not intolerable, just too slow for a camera this expensive.- They give you two customizable dial positions that you can program however you want. That's great - Canon doesn't have that. But I need more!- Vignetting is quite noticeable at wide aperture, even in JPEG mode with automatic lens correction. At f/8.0 though, it goes away. But still - one of the main points of a full-frame sensor is getting that beautiful DOF, which means using wide aperture.- Camera has &#34;auto ISO&#34; setting, BUT NO MINIMUM SHUTTER SPEED SETTING! What the heck? Well actually it does - the minimum is 1/60. But it's not user-adjustable. 1/60 is not fast enough for longer focal lengths. Waiting for a firmware upgrade.- Sucker is LOUD. You'd think that with no mirror to flop out of the way, it would be whisper-quiet. Nope. Loud as heck. Somewhat satisfying, but still loud.CAN'T COMMENTI haven't done long exposures yet - which is something I like to do.

I have tried both the clear and the matte screen protectors on all four devices.  As far as brands go, this is one of the better ones.  There are still problems getting these screen protectors on without bubbles and especially little micro fibers getting underneath during the process.  This is not the manufacturers fault but it is still irritating.  I usually end up using two to three screen protectors each time before I can get them right, and obviously I have done this a few times.  There videos are great, but you still have to do it a few times before you can get it right.  The tape that they include is okay, but kind of useless because it is so small.  With my fat fingers, I usually put more prints on the screen rather than picking up the micro fibers.  A bigger piece of tape would be nice.Now on to the actual product review.  Like I said, I have tried both the clear and the matte finishes on both the 5th gen iPod touch with retina and the 1st gen iPad Mini without retina.  The clear screen protectors give you the best picture, but picks up fingerprints and glare just as bad as the screen without anything.  The matte screen protector does a good job against glare, but it does mess with the retina display pretty bad, and is still not all that great even without the retina.  Also, the matte does not pick up fingerprints, but what is does is it gets cloudy from the skin off your fingers which can end up making your screen look cloudy, and it is tougher to wipe off than the clear screen protectors.Overall, in my opinion, they are both decent products, but not great as they both have their shortcomings.  I think maybe what I will try next is the Ballistic Glass that Tech Armor offers.  Unfortunately it is much more expensive, like $30 each instead of $7 for three.  Maybe some time in the future I will splurge.

Tonight I did a firmware update, which reminded me that I haven't reviewed it yet.Things I've noticed:1.  There's a bunch of buttons near the top of the remote for selecting which input you're using.  On the left side of the remote is a button marked &#34;receiver&#34;.  In order to do anything on the receiver, you need to press the receiver button so that the remote knows to send signals to the receiver.  It seems silly, but I spend an awfully long time trying to figure out why I couldn't get the on screen menu to respond.PROs:1.  6 HDMI inputs. Granted I'm only using one input to feed signals from a Home Theatre PC, but it's good to have expandabiltiy.2.  Self measuring room equalization.  This required a little tweaking of levels when it was done, but that's pretty normal.  I'm pretty particular about matching levels between the speakers and the subwoofer.3.  Plenty of power for the speakers.  Since I have a powered subwoofer, the 5 highpass speakers got plenty of power.  If you're not running a subwoofer, you might have issues with bass sounds clipping the amp.4.  The remote works quite well, with a pretty good layout. I've programmed the orange button in the middle of the left side to power on/off the ceiling mounted projector.CONS:1.  Other reviewers have written at length about how Zone 2 can only user certain types of input source material.2.  Various clicks/thumps/delays when switching sources.3.  Firmware updates don't work over wifi, only by wired ethernet or USB stick.As you can tell, I don't really have much negative to say about it... it works for controlling the volume, powers my speakers, flattens out the room response curve, and just plain works.

Pleasantly surprised, this Fosmon (never heard of the company before) case improves the overall look the my Nexus 7 FHD.One thing to note, this will ONLY FIT THE 2013 NEXUS 7.Cut outs are spot on. No port is obstructed, no speaker is covered up, and unlike some other cases I've used, the headphone jack isn't overprotected, so larger 3.5mm cased headphone plugs won't have much trouble with fitment, as well as the micro USB port.Power button as well as the volume rocker are covered up, allowing easy to find embossed locations.Construction feels very sturdy. It was a tight fit getting it on properly, but the end result makes it feel like part of the tabet. It really does feel like it will provide ample protection against dings and short falls. I particularly like the clear bezel and frosted back. It makes the Nexus 7 look much more modern and classy. It's also cool being able to see the &#34;nexus&#34; logo through the case. The back of the case (frosted portion, which is the entire back), is a little slippery, but not enough that it would slide on a whim.If you do have a front screen shield (mine in particular is from Bodyguardz), you'll be happy to know this case is a perfect companion for it. It seems like the measurement of the screen guard matches perfectly to where the outer bezel of the case ends. I also had a back protector too and thought I could get away with leaving it on, but it just wouldn't work; the case fits so snug, that it wouldn't fit properly with that less than .04 mm thick shield on.Overall, loving this case!

They give you a mini battery and transmitter that will replace either a AA or AAA battery in your remote control.  When you use your remote, the transmitter (which is now in your remote's battery compartment) sends a signal to the quite small flying saucer looking thing which you put by the item you want to control.  The saucer converts the radio signal to Infra Red which by way of the emitter (with a nice long wire for convenience) that you stick over the IR window on the controlled device.

It took 3 reboots for the 3 partitions on my Asus N53SV-X1 quad-core (2630QM@ 2gHz) laptop, but worked flawlessly. That software also lets you optimize the migration for SSDs.2. The boot time for the basic machine with nothing connected dropped from 2:27 to 0:27. I can live with that. With all my junk hooked to the computer, external keyboard, trackball, 3 extra HD monitors on USB video cards, plus a Magic Jack Plus USB which has a long driver install routine, the boot time went from 3:05 to 0:45. Slower, but that's a real world number.3. As others have mentioned, everything is snappier, including web browsing, Large file loading/parsing for video editing has improved about 100%.4. I also went from 4gB to 8gB of RAM and re-tested. No real speed difference, though it will be handy for editing.Conclusion: Get an SSD before you increase RAM, unless you have some really pressing need for RAM. (I'm not a gamer.)

Had I a choice, I would have selected black because the white shows dirt way to easily.  Not usually an issue unless the device is meant to be portable and used all over the place (which is how I use it).Overall, I really enjoy the functionality and the sound from this speaker.  As spring is just kicking off, I've been using this speaker outside as I've have been doing work around the house.  It sounds incredible at mid to really loud levels.  An amusing side story..  I was testing the speaker outside on a nice sunny day and got into a discussion about hawks and eagles with a friend.  I have an Audubon Birds app on my phone, so I was playing the sound of hawks very loudly through the speaker.  After that, we looked up and there was a single bird moving or flying in any of the trees in my back yard. At all.  A testament to the quality and volume of sound for this speaker.Even at low volumes I did not have any issues with this speaker.  The sound was clear and smooth.  Possibly not as crisp as it could have been, still very good.There are some concerns I have with the speaker...- Buttons - wish there was more tactical feel for a button press.  Since there is a slight delay in the response to the volume buttons, it can be annoying to use the buttons.- DLNA - Configuring the DLNA was not intuitive.  I am still not sure if I got it working right.  Airplay and Bluetooth were easy.  I usually focus on Bluetooth anyway.- iPhone App - the App looked nice (turns out, like lipstick on a pig), but using it was non-intuitive and a PAIN in the butt.  SPEND MORE TIME ON DEVELOPING YOUR APPS!  This is a common problem.  Companies spend all their time developing their cool product and then do a phone app as an afterthought.  Since this device can do all kinds of things beyond the buttons on the device... your app suddenly becomes your primary interface to the device.  Treat the app that way.  (-1 star)Price... I think if HK wants to product to take off, the price will need to come down.  Truly I like the product... have enjoyed using it and look forward to using it.  Still..  I doubt I'd purchase it at the current price.Overall... as a product, love my HK portable speaker.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great speaker to do projects with", "unixReviewTime": 1398556800, "reviewTime": "04 27, 2014"}

I have a rather large ear canal and always use the largest included tip, where the custom shaped clear one provided the best passive noise isolation I ever experienced with any of in-ears.The first thing you notice when you take these headphones out - how super lightweight and compact they are. The barrel of these earpieces is made out of lightweight aluminum material and has a great ergonomics to fit comfortably inside of your ear. The barrel opening is covered by a cloth material filter (5 replacement pairs included), and right next to the strain relief there is a pinhole port for sound shaping. Followed by a decent strain relief the cables use a durable shiny rubber coating up until the y-splitter. Included chin slider moves very smoothly and made out of the same aluminum material. After y-splitter, the cable has a &#34;shoe lace&#34; type of cloth material cover which is still very durable and doesn't have that annoying springy effect found with so many other cables. The cable is terminated by a gold plated 3.5mm angled connector with a flexible strain relief. I also noticed microphonics effect was down to minimum.When it comes to sound quality, RE-400 delivers amazing results! This single dynamic driver in-ear really focuses to deliver a neutral transparent sound but unlike other neutral headphones that sound lifeless - these are very smooth and warm. The sound is not in your face, it's a few steps back, but it sounds very natural without any artificial enhancement. The characteristics that surprised me the most was the low end where neutral headphones usually try hard to show details but lack the extension. Here, you still get a very detailed bass sound without any humps, but it actually extends beyond mid-bass punch down to some sub-bass texture. It's not enhanced or boosted, just perfect to enjoy your low frequencies, well controlled without spilling into mids. I found bass to be not as fast in comparison to my other headphones, but it's very well rounded and full. Mids are very detailed, clear, maybe a bit forward but not too much. The vocals sound very natural and lush. High frequency (treble) is extended, detailed, bright but not harsh and without any hint of sibilance. Upper mids/treble is very well controlled and just perfect for extended listening period without ear fatigue. The soundstage is average, not too wide which was definitely a step back from RE-400B balanced version that had an amazing 3D width. But this is in-line with other similar IEMs, while balanced wiring/architecture is intended to widen the sound. The headphones were really easy to drive from my phone and X5, but I did notice I had to dial in a higher volume level to enjoy them more.Overall, I knew that I will not be disappointed with RE-400, and my testing just solidified that! No matter what genre of music you are listening to, these headphones will guarantee to bring out the best in every song. The sound has just a perfect balance of neutral natural tones without going into any extreme. Perhaps if you are a basshead craving for a more bass impact or need an analytical bright set of headphones - these might not be your cup of tea. But as all around headphones that sounds and looks great, and has a very reasonable pricing in comparison to other single and multi-driver IEMs in the sound sound category - these deserve a serious consideration.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Amazing sound quality!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1399766400, "reviewTime": "05 11, 2014"}

I am often in harsh conditions and like to have my iPad with me because I keep almost everything I need during the day on it.  While I take very good care of my equipment, I need to be confident that I am not going to damage my expensive electronics.What this case is not &#8212; it is not waterproof, it is water resistant.  I have had a number of so called waterproof cases, and they all have failed at some point.  I prefer the water resistant cases as they do not give you a false sense that you are protected.  The front of this case is pretty well sealed, but the back does have some open places water can enter.  I feel confident it will protect against light rain and spray, which will account for 99% of the environment where one would try to use an iPad.What this case is - expendable.  When you think about the money invested in an iPad, you want to ensure it lasts.  This case will eventually wear out, get dropped, have the face significant scratched, etc - and that is exactly what you want to happen.  Given this case costs less than 5% of my iPad, let it takes the falls and protect your precious investment.Now on the the good and not as good &#8212;Good - The case seems well protected and durable.  The outer rubber shell is stiff and feels very durable.  It is a smoother type rubber, not the &#8220;sticky&#8221; rubber that attracts lint and dirt.  The home button is well protected and has a very solid feel underneath the protective case.  All of the ports are still accessible, including the charge port - which is often too small for some aftermarket charge cords, but not in this case.  The protective screen is solid and clear, it shows no signs of bubbling underneath.  I like the case stand - it is metal and is very sturdy to hold up the device.Not as good - two concerns with the leather strap.  First of all, it is difficult to adjust to a smaller size.  Second, as I got the leather strap wet it held water for quite some time.  While it looks very nice and feels rugged, I am not sure it would not be better with some other type of syntactic material.Neither good nor bad - just part of having a case.  This is not a case you will want to take your iPad in and out of often.  Once it goes in, you will want to leave it is not easy removing and will weaken the case over time.  You also have to get used to the protective screen surface.  it is slightly less &#8220;smooth&#8221; when using, but typical of all screen protectors and still very usable.Overall I would recommend.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good protection / great price value", "unixReviewTime": 1395360000, "reviewTime": "03 21, 2014"}

I needed something strong for use a few times each week in local travel and it came down to this Davis and Sanford model vs. its closest competitors (Fancier Studio 270a and Ravelli AVTP).  I chose this one because I needed more height than the other two offer (note they all have the bowl mount - not the crank up center piece - very important for quick leveling). I'm 6'4\" and am very comfortable viewing through the camera even with the legs spread out all the way --- lens height maybe 5'10\" or more (guessing). It also seemed to be more beefy where the leg extentions are concerned.  I assume all the heads are good, but can say this FM18 head is a dream to use. It is extraordinarilly smooth and can be locked securely if needed.I do not have the other tripods to compare, but can say without reservation that this was a very, very good choice and incredible value.  By the way, there has been some confusion about what the \"XB\" in the model means...I have no idea. The leg decal just has branding and says \"7518B.\" This model came with the nice carrying bag, two plates, both 3/8 and 1/4 interchangeable mounting screws etc; it is 100% complete.

After several seconds, the blue led on i10s will start to quick flash.6) When the i10s and your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver are paired and connected the i10s blue LED will slow flash once in every ~5 secs7) If you don't hear any music on Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker, check to make surea. iDevice is not in pause mode. If in pause mode, change to play modeb. iDevice volume is not at minimum - move the volume control on iDevice to make sure volume changes and not at minimum.c. Your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker volume is not at minimum, if at minimum - increase your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker volume.8) If unsuccessful, remove i10s from iDevice. Power off your Bluetooth Headset/Receiver/Speaker. Repeat steps 1 to step 7 again. If fail 3 times, steps 1-7, let us know.The LG headset controls my iPod Classic very well. I believe to choose another album to play on iPod, you would have to do that on the iPod itself. However, with my headset I can control volume, FF to next song or Reverse to last song or go back to beginning of album by several presses of the Back Reverse button on my headset. Now I am motivated to plan out more LONG playlists on my iPod. Yeah!!Other reviewers have said to put iPod volume at maximum, this was too loud for me on my LG headset's lowest setting, SO I put the iPod volume at just a bit above 1/2 level, and now volume control on headset goes from a nice low but well heard volume to just 5 or 6 clicks of headphone up volume button takes me right into the WAY TOO LOUD level.ALSO, I do know that volume setting when higher does deplete the iPod battery life quite a bit faster. So, half way for me works nicely. So if this helps save battery power and iPod battery lasts longer, YAY!UPDATE ON MY EXPERIMENT: My iPod BATTERY LIFE EXPERIMENT WITH KOKKIO BT DONGLE: I started playing my iPod Classic 160GB On Friday 2/7/14 at 5:18 pm. Stopped play at 10:03pm = 4.75 hoursSaturday: started at 11:00am, stopped at 5:42 pm. = 6 hr 42 min.TOTAL = 11 hr 16 minHOWEVER, I did leave the Kokkio dongle plugged into iPod on Friday evening, iPod battery level was about 70%, BUT when I restarted iPod Saturday at 11am, battery level was at about 40% on my iPod.Conclusion, possibly the Kokkia Dongle draws power from iPod battery if left plugged in even though it's not BT connected to anything.I will redo my experiment again on full batteries, early in the day so I don't have to interrupt it for sleep.Then another day I will leave Kokkia Dongle plugged into iPod when it's fully charged to see if there is battery drainage by the end of the day.EXPECT AN UPDATE.I placed my iPod with the Kokkia BT dongle inserted, and placed it on the kitchen breakfast bar which is central in my home 1980sq.ft. and I'm able to walk throughout my home without any cutting out. So range for me is good.Battery info, just a FYI re my experiences. As an ex Electronic Test technician, I tend to discharge ALL batteries that are rechargeable totally and completely, then give the item-battery a full charge without interruption. (I have one of the first hard drive mp3 players, Rio Riot, that is 13 years old, that still carries a charge for about 14 hours. I still have it and it works.) RC car enthusiasts use a lightbulb to drain their batteries before recharging them for this very same reason. I do NOT believe there is NO battery memory problems with NiMH batteries like what was known on NiCad rechargeables back many years ago.iPod CASE and this Kokkio: I had researched iPod cases, as most of my clothing does not have pockets available, so I need a belt clip case. I did find a nice protective case that I might want that does hook to your waistband or belt. This is the case: http://www.amazon.com/CrazyOnDigital-Premium-Leather-Classic-Package-Black/dp/B002AF5184/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topHowever, my issue/questions was whether the Kokkio BT dongle would fit into the case fully. Now that I have the Kokkia dongle in my iPod, see that the Kokkia BT dongle is actually a little bit smaller and has very smooth rounded edges compared to the charging plug/cord USB for iPod, and there is a cutout in the case to fit the charge plug. SO, I feel that this Kokkia BT dongle will fit fine with this or any other iPod case you might want to purchase because all of them have the cutout for the charging cord. .I DO UPDATE ALL my reviews as needed on ALL electronics goodies, also after 6 months and then again about a year after purchase and use, so if a few years goes by without an update, it's still working fine. LOL, or I died. But I do have many years left if life goes to plan.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pairing Instructions in my Review. So Far, So Good! Kokkia!

This performs as well as that with a lot more speed. Side by side photos on the screen look the same (d50 is 6.0 megapixel). Printed there is probably a difference. However, this camera is much faster in burst mode and also shoots video, which is why I got it. What I miss is the internal motor for AF on older lenses, but I can handle focusing manually. Non AF-S lenses are (mostly) still compatible, which is why I like Nikon. I don't have any complaints, it just wasn't the step up from the D50 that I had imagined.

First the installation of the iPad into the case is very simple, just line it up with the correct orientation and just push it in place until the sides click into position. Once the iPad is installed it can then rotate 360 degrees to view in landscape or portrait view.  The side of the case that sits up against the screen has a soft, felt-like material so as to be very good at not scratching your screen.  Some of the material (be it vinyl or leather-like) on the blue and white part has some wrinkles around the corner of the case, however this is not a deal breaker as it's not peeling or coming off in any way it just shows that it's not something that is of perfect quality.  AS for the closing of the case, I have not experienced any of the indicated problems that others may have had with the magnets not shutting the screen off.  I have tested it and it takes about a quarter to half and inch of separation before the screen will come back on.  One thing I have noticed, if you set your iPad down and don't use the elastic band, just make sure you set it down with the large red part on the bottom and the iPad screen facing downward, that way the weight of the iPad will force itself as close to the red part of the case with the magnet in it.

{"reviewerID": "AB0ZI13CLWPL6", "asin": "B00J49ZH6K", "reviewerName": "Dangs \"Dan\"", "helpful": [162, 171], "reviewText": "Finally received my Samsung Chromebook 2 (11.6\" version, jet black color) and have had a day to get it set up, mess around with it, and compare it to myAcer C720 Chromebook (2GB), as well as my previous experiences with the originalSamsung Chromebookthat was released back in 2012. My initial up front experience is that I am overall very satisfied with the improvements that Samsung has made! There are some areas I wish they improved, but overall for the price, this is an outstanding way to experience the Chrome OS. I'll touch on a few of my in-depth thoughts below, and I'll update this all in the future as I have more experience with the device. I'm going to focus more on the hardware and less on the operating system or software, since the OS will remain fairly consistent across all Chromebook devices and plenty of information already exists about Chrome OS online:Design/Materials/Build Quality: As mentioned above, I went with the jet black version. This new Chromebook 2 features Samsungs \"stitched leather\" design to the outside of the top shell, similar to what you see if you have ever used their Galaxy Note 3. It stands out a lot more when you see it spread across a much larger device like this. I'm going to be honest, I think some people are going to find this slightly tacky looking/feeling (especially the fake stitching around the edges), but personally I am a much bigger fan of it than I thought. For a computing device in this price range, you cannot really expect them to be able to throw on a full aluminum/metal case like you might find on a MacBook Pro or a higher end Ultrabook laptop. You're going to get something that is plastic or a more cost effective material, and honestly, I kind of like the way that this faux-leather design makes it stand out from other devices. And the overall build quality of the Chromebook 2 feels much improved over the original. It doesn't have as much \"flex\" to it, and even though it is still almost entirely plastic-based, it certainly feels like a step up. Also, compared to my Acer C720 side by side, the Samsung CB2 feels significantly higher in quality.Display: My Chromebook 2 is the 11.6\" model. This is one of the very few areas where I am finding myself wishing that Samsung would have improved this new model, even if it came at a slight cost increase. The resolution on the 11.6\" model is only 1366x768, which is the same as you'll find on pretty much every other Chromebook aside from the Pixel (which is way too expensive), and the upcoming 13\" version of the Chromebook 2 (which will more to a full HD 1920 screen). I'm actually OK with the resolution topping out at only 1366x768 on a screen of this size, but they are still using a TN-based panel when I think that they should have stepped it up to an IPS panel and really made it stand out. It's about on par with the screen on my Acer C720, doesn't feel like much of an improvement. I wouldn't consider myself too overly picky, but side by side with a device with an IPS panel, and the screen on the Chromebook 2 just looks kind of dull and washed out in comparison. According to the specs I've seen, even the 13\" version of the Chromebook 2 is going to have a TN panel (just in higher resolution), so I wouldn't be surprised to hear more people complaining about this aspect.Processor/RAM: The Chromebook 2 utilizes one of Samsung's own ARM-based chips, called the \"Exynos 5 Octa 5420\", which is rated at 1.9GHz. Most of the computing experiences in my life outside of smartphone use have been with either an Intel or an AMD processor; even my trusty Acer C720 Chromebook uses an Intel Celeron-based processor. I was a little hesitant to make the jump to a newer generation of Chromebook without an Intel processor since I know Acer is going to soon release a variant of the C720 with an Intel i3 chip. However, so far, I am quite impressed with how quick this Exynos 5 Octa chip has felt through normal use. I haven't run any actual benchmarking programs or applications (if someone has a suggestion, I'll be glad to try one, if they even exist for Chrome OS?), but directly comparing it side-by-side to the Acer C720 running on the 1.4GHz Celeron processor, this is no comparison. Apps load much more instantly on the new Chromebook 2, but the biggest difference can be seen when using anything that involves video. Doing a Google Hangout on my older Chromebook was always slightly laggy enough that it was moderately frustrating, especially when trying to multi-task during a hangout. That lag has seemingly disappeared with this new model, and in all honesty, I haven't found a task yet where I've been wishing that it was faster than it is now. This may also partially be aided by the fact that the Chromebook 2 has 4gb of RAM, versus my Acer C720 which only has 2gb, and my previous experiences with the original Chromebook 1 which also only had 2gb. Either way, the improvement in speed has been fantastic and you will certainly notice it.Keyboard/Touchpad: This is one of the most important things to me on any computing device I own. Nothing is more frustrating than a keyboard with a weird design or layout that becomes a permanent hassle for the life of the device. Luckily, this might be the BEST overall feature of the Chromebook 2. Normally when I get a new device, I find myself needing a period of adjustment as I get used to the feel of a new keyboard, new keys, new layout. I found myself instantly loving the feel and use of the keyboard on the Chromebook 2. The keys feel sturdy and solid, and the spacing feels very natural between keys. The keys themselves have a very natural \"curved\" feel to the top of them that yields a very pleasant typing experience. Honestly the best possible comment that I think I can give an input device is that it feels so natural and correct that you immediately stop thinking about it once you start using it, and that is the case here. I didn't have many complaints about the keyboard on my Acer C720, but I can definitely say that the keyboard on this Chromebook 2 is noticeably improved and Samsung did a great job here. The touchpad itself is pleasantly wide (wider than the spacebar!) and feels accurate and smooth. Overall I can say without a doubt that this is the best keyboard and touchpad I've used on any Chromebook device to date outside of the Pixel.Hard Drive/Storage: My 11.6\" Chromebook 2 came with a 16gb solid-state hard drive, only a little over half of which is actually accessible by the user to use as storage. Everyone has different needs so opinions will vary on this, but one of the main draws of Google OS and the Chromebooks are how well they function as cloud devices. Other than space used to install apps, which for the most part are very small (20mb or less in size), almost everything else I use my Chromebooks for can be performed from the cloud or require very little onboard storage. There are many options available to store files, pictures, data on the cloud (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc), so I honestly don't think the storage space is going to be much of an issue for most people. Plus, being that it is a solid-state drive, it is VERY fast compared to traditional hard drives in terms of accessing files and data; also, since solid state drives have no moving parts inside, a lot more stable and damage proof for lugging it around on-the-go. Unless you are going to be installing literally hundreds of apps (most people probably only regularly use two dozen or less), or unless you regularly need to work where you have no internet access at all for extended periods of time, I  think the size of the drive will suffice.Battery: This is a section I will need to update further in the future. Samsung is claiming 8 hours of battery life on a full charge. I haven't noticed anything yet that would lead me to believe this claim is false, but I also haven't owned it long enough to go through a full charge from start to finish. I'll update my thoughts on this after I have run a few full cycles through the battery.Speakers: I'll be honest, I don't personally use the built-in speakers a ton on any laptop or device I've owned. I'm typically either just using this for web browsing or productivity, but when I do listen to music with it, I've found myself using Bluetooth to connect to external Bluetooth speakers in the past (namely my Logitech Boombox or my Jawbone Jambox if I am on the go). I did test the speakers out for a while though on my Chromebook 2, and I have to say I am fairly impressed. Considering that the speakers are located on the bottom of the device, I was surprised at how well they projected sound. And considering their tiny size, they were able to get louder than I expected while remaining fairly clear. I wouldn't expect booming base from these, but they don't sound \"tinny\" either and have a decent balance to them. I'll still probably stick to using my Bluetooth speakers when I want to blast music around my house or when working outdoors, but I can't see the built-in speakers disappointing anyone who came in with reasonable expectations.Other features: I'll come back to this and add to my review once I have had more time with the unit. Webcam, software, pictures, any other likes or dislikes that I find as I continue to use it further beyond the first few days.Overall, this is a great product, especially when you factor in the value that you get for the money. If I could give it partial stars, I'd give it about a 4.6/5 (and the only deduction would really be because I wish they had upgraded the screen further). It's very very quick in everyday use; boots up almost instantly from sleep (or about 10 total seconds if you shut it off completely), gets very solid battery life, and ChromeOS allows you to easily do almost any normal computing task that you would normally do with Apple OS or Windows. It's very lightweight and portable, and the build quality is solid. If you come in expecting this to perform like a $1000+ i7 Ultrabook or a MacBook Pro, you might leave disappointed. But other than that, especially at a price point of just over $300 at launch, I feel like the Chromebook 2 is not only going to sell a lot of new customers on the Chrome OS, but offer a very noticeable speed and function upgrade to people who are using previous generation Chromebook models. If you have only used traditional laptops your whole life and this is your first experience into Chrome OS, your mind is going to be blown when you first realize that you are INSTANTLY at the desktop and ready to go when you open the laptop up from sleep mode. I will revisit my review and update it further as time passes and I notice new things to comment on. Anything you want me to review that I missed, let me know in the comments and I'll come back and add my thoughts.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A solid upgrade from the last generation of Chromebook models", "unixReviewTime": 1400112000, "reviewTime": "05 15, 2014"}

But I am disappointed with this item and looking straight into replacing it after just 2 months of use.I was using Windows notebooks for most of my computing life till 2 years back when I need a light weight notebook of 2.5 Kg or below, minimum of 16GB and a Quad-core i7 notebook (I do development works and my works are mostly out of country). I ended up with Macbook pro (retina) and that is the only machine at that time that met this requirement (shame on Wintel). Fast forward now and I am looking for a same high computing power, touch screen, lighter notebook cum tablet running Win8.1. I ended up with this item after all the great reviews here and elsewhere.At the point of purchase, I accepted the following facts:1. It is only be 8GB,2. It has the yellow display problem,but:1. It is light weight2. It is flexible and able to twist into a tablet3. It is touch screen4. Reasonably price (ps. not low price)However, after just two months of usage. I reverted back to Macbook Pro for most of my usage because this item has too many design faults because Lenovo is using mostly low quality components beyond the aspect of looks.Let me highlight bellow and I these are unlikely to be a one-off problem that you might think.1. Distorted yellow colour display problem remain unresolved with the latest BIOS upgrade - Yes, despite claims from some websites, the problem is here. See it for yourself, just run MS Paint program and look at the yellow in the colour menu and compare it with the next unit in the showroom and you will know what I meant. Gee.. why give you a 3200 x 1800 ultra high resolution when you cannot even display basic colour correctly?2. Only 1 mini-HDMI (faulty) display - my job required frequent presentation. The mini-HDMI port design so poorly that most mini-HDMI cables cannot have a good contact to receive signal. 90% of the time, you are unable to display unless you make some cuttings to the cable and risk damaging them and still not working, I brought 3 cables and followed the instructions most other owners suggested and managed to get one cable to work. And this is after I stacked some objects below the connecting part to cause the connector to tilt upward (It is too complex to explain here without a diagram here but you can surely do a search on the Internet, especially the Lenovo owner forum,  to understand what I mean)3. To mitigate the above, I thought of a &#8220;wise&#8221; idea to overcome this shortcoming - Invest in a wireless display (Widi) since this unit supposed to support Widi. Widi allow you to connect to a projector remotely via a USB port and that perhaps can solve my problem.  I bought a Netgear PTV3000 Wireless Display Adapter. This adapter works with every of my WIDI compatible devices except Yoga 2 pro. Once again, after searching in the forum, I realise this is a design issue4. Wifi - After wasted many days of testing, I realised that this unit cannot run the dual-band WIFI 802.11n network. it will only accept the 2.4GHz band but not the faster 5GHz band and this was again confirmed by many other owners. Goodness me, when the new Macbook Air release much earlier, it uses the latest 802.11ac and my 4 years old ASUS notebook support dual-band without any problem. Beside this, moving further away from the router, my 1.5 years-old Samsung S4 connected on the same 2.4G wifi router running about 3 times faster that this notebook; I was speechless.So, my experience with this unit has been that the more you use it, the more problems you will uncover, and probably to the extent that you will end up putting it a side as a white-elephant or for my case, using it to play some youtube videos which can be done using my home TV set too.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Please do more research before you purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1398902400, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2014"}

The earphones fit comfortably and were effective in keeping out all but the loudest ambient noise. The ear tips that came on the set were comfortable for my ears, but there were six other sets of varying sizes and firmness, so virtually any user should be able to find a good fit. Hard-wired earphones like these don't give the freedom of movement that Bluetooth earphones have, but the tradeoff is that there's no internal battery to keep charged, and you don't have to worry about drop-outs when you're moving around.I used the M5 earphones with a playlist of songs that gave them a good workout. I first used a couple of utility MP3s (Channel Balance Test and Stepped Stereo Pan Test) to check the stereo channel balance and stereo separation, and the earphones passed with flying colors. I don't claim to be an expert audiophile, but to my ear, the sound was at least as good as any earphones that I've used, including Bluetooth earphones.I'm also impressed with the accessories that came with the earphones. The six sets of different earbuds (plus the set that's on the earphones) are a very nice touch, plus a clip for hooking the audio cable to your shirt. The hard case that's included is great for carrying everything in a very small package.In my opinion, if you're looking for a set of quality earphones, the Brainwavz M5 Earphones are definitely worth considering.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Outstanding audio from a comfortable set of wired earphones", "unixReviewTime": 1394064000, "reviewTime": "03 6, 2014"}

You also have to purchase a $15 app for your iPhone or iPad.The other way to do it, without this adapter, is to use a Roku, or other streaming video player with a Slingbox.

The overall shape and design never appealed to me. I transitioned from the Gamecube to the original xbox and was always a Xbox user. I tried many times to enjoy a Playstation console but could never get myself to like the dualshock controllers.In November I picked up the Xbox one and recently (May 2014) traded it in and switched to a PS4. The PS4 in my opinion is really targeted to gamers. The Xbox One is targeted to those who want an all around experience with games and entertainment. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed my Xbox One but with the direction Microsoft is going, doubting its decision, downgrading the price, I wasn't having it. Microsoft really cheated its early adopter by dropping the price due to the lack of interest of the kinect. Followed by having customers buy adapters for headsets and a charging kit.In this review I'll will be comparing both systems in a number of categories and explain their pros and cons in my preference.*Design*At launch as mentioned earlier I picked up the Xbox One. The design never really bothered me but it was a very large machine. It took a lot of space on my tv stand because of its size, the power brick and kinect. After switching to the PS4, I can't believe what a difference there was. The PS4 took 1/3 less room on my TV stand and was thinner. It had a better sleek design and a much more appealing look. Lets be honest the Xbox One looks like a bulky cable box. When it comes to looks the PS4 takes the win for that category.With the history of the red ring microsoft ensured to keep their new system cool in which they achieved greatly. But the top fan would collect dust along the grill and I would constantly try to wipe away any build up which was really annoying. I did like how the Xbox One had many USB ports where as the PS4 has 2. The PS4 design is slim and stylish. I like the lit up line going through the system. My one complaint is the design in the back. Being diagonal it was a little annoying plugging things in because of the recessed ports due to the back pointing out, if that made sense.Both systems share their combinations of matte and glossy finishes but the PS4 has the better stylish design while still providing slightly better hardware.*Controller*As I mentioned earlier the controller was a big deal to me. I always preferred the Xbox controller because of the triggers and the position of the thumb sticks. The Xbox One controllers felt a little bigger but I liked the design, it might not seem like a huge feature but the impulse triggers were really nice and loved that feature. Problem is the Xbox one controller requires an additional adapter no matter what headset you're using unless you're using the stock headset. Also instead of running through batteries, they sell a charging kit. In total that's an extra $45 + tax. That is ridiculous, microsofts vision of a motion sensor should completely stop in my opinion. They could of easily never added the kinect and used the extra $100 to include a charging kit and adapter.With the PS4 at first I was skeptical because I feared I would not like the new Dual shock 4. But after playing with it at the store I've grown to like it a lot. I do like that they indented the thumb sticks because a big reason why I never liked the dual shock was because of the domed shape sticks. That's just my preference. Also the previous dual shock the L2 and R2 were weird to me because I prefer a trigger like button for shooters. They slightly changed the triggers on the DS4, it might not be a trigger like the xbox but it feels better in the hands. I love how the system came with a charging cable and any 3rd party headsets will work without any additions accessories! That was a big plus on Sony's part.Both controllers have their pros and cons, I still do favor the overall shape of the xbox controller but I am loving the Dual shock 4. I understand there have been complaints on the battery life on the Dual shock 4 but hopefully overtime quality control could change that. The quality and feel of the xbox one controller felt cheap, the plastic they used didn't seem up to par with the 360 controller. The PS4 controller really felt like a quality build.*User Interface*The Xbox Ones interface is pretty much a windows 8 appearance. The UI in my opinion was a huge step back because the UI was designed towards using voice command instead using the controller. I prefer using a controller to navigate. The Xbox One's UI is very slow in my opinion, its too flashy by having things pop in and out, a waste of load time, hiding things within category folders, and pushing what app was last used. I would constantly get frustrated in finding things and constantly closing applications. The 360's UI before the launch of the one was great. While microsoft are constantly updating its UI, its still not up to pair as a next gen in my opinion. Like the biggest complaint was checking storage space and battery life. Are you kidding me? Those two are almost standard in ANY DEVICE. The direction of the xbox UI was completely pulled back because they designed it with the kinect in mind.The PS4 design has a learning curve especially if you're coming from the xbox. But it is very simple and straight forward which I really liked. Essentially there are two home bars which hold specific icons. After sitting down getting used to the UI it is very responsive in my opinion. Things load quickily, I can easily find what I need whether it be settings, accounts, space, etc. I can easily see who's online unlike the xbox where I have to navigate through an annoying wall feed. The icons are small and titled where as the xbox have large boxes that take up space. Everything is right in front of you on the PS4 UI where the One has 3 sections. I just wished you could change the background or color of the PS4, unless I haven't noticed that feature. At times I find the blue a little too blended in with the white text.With the PS4 I experienced the UI at update 1.70? I believe so I can't compare the UI's from launch. Microsoft has been providing updates and announcements but its still not easily navigated on the PS4 in my opinion. The UI's for both systems will change overtime as we've seen from the last generation. Overall they both has their issues and needed updates but the PS4 gets my vote for my preference in navigation.*Gameplay + Visual*The Xbox One has slightly weaker hardware because their company, microsoft focuses on software. Comparing the multi-platform games the PS4 has a slight edge from what I've experienced.One of the best looking games Tomb Raider the Definitive Edition looks amazing both on the PS4 and Xbox One. But in my experience it ran smoother on the PS4. Multi-platform games will most likely run a higher setting on the PS4 because Sony is a hardware company and provided better parts into the system. The Xbox One could of been on the same level but included parts to compensate for their \"all in one\" media entertainment. I'm not saying one overpowers the other but their is a slight difference on the multi-platform games. What makes each console shine is their exclusives.Forza 5 was beautiful, the cars looked incredibly detailed and the sound was amazing. Forza 5 shows the Xbox One can compete graphically with the PS4. Another game which showed off its hardware was Dead Rising 3 which I heavily enjoyed. The amount of polygons (character models, zombies) was amazing. I really felt surrounded with a never ending crowd of zombies. It didn't run a high frame rate because of the amount of objects that were shown on the screen at once. Its a graphic sacrifice to show that many models on one screen. I am eager to see what 343 does with Halo 5, Halo 4 really pushed the limits of the XBox 360 and that was a beautiful game.As of this review I played Infamous SS and I was in love. That game looks incredibly beautiful especially with the recently added feature of taking screen shots within the game bring it to another level. While this was the only exclusive I played on the PS4 as of right now I can say that infamous is one of the best looking games out there now (May 2014). It ran very smooth and the details within the game looked nice and crisp. I loved the detail to how the main character absorbed his powers with the neon lights. An exclusive I look forward to is another Naughty Dog produces, the first being the remastered version of the Last of Us and hopefully a new Uncharted.*Xbox Live and PS Plus*- The Xbox shines in this category because they've been in designing hardware the longest out of the two. Plus even though Playstion owners would bash xbox users for paying for xbox live, that money (or so I hope) was used to create a better service. To make sure it was secure, better connectivity, dedicated servers and market. I still feel like $60 for a year is still of a steep price. But I recommend to those who are looking into getting Xbox Live to always wait for prices drops. You can find Xbox Live deals going for $35-$40 for a year membership. The xbox live market will always be a better market because of the paying members. But like I mentioned earlier the UI designed pulled back xbox live. Going through the market is sometimes slow and the arrangement isn't clean. Xbox Live Gold members as of now have access to demos, streaming services, and games with gold.- PSN Plus and the Playstation store is great, but they will eventually catch up to the level of xbox live due to the growing paying members of plus. The Playstation store has a little learning curve for me coming from the xbox, but it wasn't hard. If anything it was easier to find things and view the different offers in the playstation store. The price for a year is $50 but you can find deals going for $30-$40 at times. The other day during the Watch Dogs release PS store was doing a maintenance. While it was annoying especially during a peak launch of a new game, it gave me confidence that Sony is really trying to develop and improve their online service. Similar to gold, play station does offer free games to plus users.*Overall and final thoughts*Both systems have their pros and cons. Each pro and con can be different to each their own, it really is up to the user on how they are going to use the system and what they prefer. The way I see it as if you prefer the exclusives on the Xbox One, choose the Xbox One. You'll be getting a system that has their great line up of exclusives, Dead Rising 3, Halo 5, Sunset Overdrive, etc. Plus a system that really provides entertainment through media apps and if you plug in your tv. Tie that with kinect using voice command, its a nice set. But thats if you purchase the console with kinect since in June they will be releasing a Xbox One without kinect at $399. I took that drop as a slap to the face from microsoft who were early adopters, plus xbox live gold, and the additional accessories.If exclusives aren't a big deal to you and you're just an average user I would say to choose the PS4. You'll have a slightly better looking multi-platform games, plus PS4's great exclusives. You can still use the console for media such as Netflix, Amazon Instant and more.But for those who are looking for a \"gaming\" console, I honestly would go for the PS4. This system really feels like its designed towards video games. Microsoft in my opinion lost the vision of being a \"gaming console\" by adding kinect and focusing on being an all in one system. Sony took a great direction with the PS4 and I am look forward to its future and games. Just remember their isn't a right side, it goes back on how you use your console and what you're looking out of it.For me the Playstation 4 fits my preference and use. It's at a great price, a good line of of exclusives, slightly better multi-platform games, overall a better value.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Xbox user who officially switched to PS4", "unixReviewTime": 1401321600, "reviewTime": "05 29, 2014"}

This third unit, like the first, randomly subtracted 51 minutes from my elapsed time during the middle of a 3.5 hour run.  My last unit locked up anytime I tried to navigate and crashed during my last 100 miler, making it unusable for the last 50 miles.  With this, my THIRD Fenix2 unit in three months, I have never had a single week of training without a glitch, dropped sensors, lockups, dropped breadcrumb trail or the like.  Perhaps 4th time's a charm?  The only thing less reliable than the watch is Garmin's tech support, who continually says \"wow, we've never heard of that happening before.\"  Bullpucky.  The forums are littered with people with tons of problems and no love from Garmin.  This watch is a joke.  A mean one.------------PRIOR REVIEW:  I've had it less than a month, and and had no fewer than eight unique and serious lockup or totally whacky failures with it. I will note that if I do an activity for an hour or two, no issues. It's when you `push' the thing on a 4/5/6+ hour run that it fails in some manner more times than not. Here's an example of what you too can experience on a long run, which is what happened to me on my 100k trail race (running) yesterday, even with Garmin's 'stable' v2.9 update:1. Around an hour and fifty minutes (1:50), the heart rate monitor and the footpod were lost. This is a common occurrence with this watch.2. About 30 min later, the entire watch locked up. While running (during the race, damnit), I pressed and held the light key to shut it off, then on again. When it came back on, the HR and footpod were reading again, and the elapsed race time seemed to be about right.3. The HR and footpod worked the rest of the race, but the next issue was so totally ridiculous that I'm still a bit in shock: when the elapsed time on the watch would get up to about 3:30, it would then drop down something around 2:15, and then continue to add time until the mid-three hour point, then, and I saw it with my own eyes, drop down to the low two hour point. It continued to do this cycle the entire 11 hours I was racing. I am seriously not making this up. I have pictures and video to prove it from the end of the race (because seriously, no one runs 100k/62 miles with 12k feet in elevation gain in under 5 hours), but that's what this ridiculous watch reported in the elapsed time field.4. The map page showed an arrow where I was, but... no track laid down. Nothing. Which kinda made it useless for navigating.Summary: $400 fitness GPS watch that cannot consistently report back on fitness, doesn't function as a GPS, and apparently can't even be relied on as a stopwatch.From what I've seen, I really do think you need to be doing 3+ hour runs (or whatever) to see the consistent, regular failures of this thing. If all you do is train for one or two hours (which is fine, that's not a judgment), then it might work for you.

I give the enclosure four stars because it does work the way it is supposed to per their documentation.  I can't give it five stars without some improvements.The first disappointment was expected based on other reviews.  The enclosure is not made to be reopened.  However, the first enclosure I received would not charge.  After talking to Macally Technical and Customer support I returned the enclosure and received a new one, which works perfectly.  But most important, since I wanted to remove my drive before returning the enclosure, I found that if you are careful you can open the enclosure without breaking it!  I wouldn't do it more than once, though.The second bit of disappointment isn't Macally's fault.  My iTunes library is almost 1TB and I had considered using this enclosure with a 1TB drive as my iTunes drive.  That idea works OK with my Macbook Pro, but it won't work with my iPhone or iPad because of the way iTunes stores files on the i-devices.  So instead I have two folders on this drive.  One contains my favorite MP3s and the other movies that do not have DRM.  This format works with the i-devices using the Macally iOS app.  I don't store documents on this drive because I find that the cloud (I use a few but primarily Dropbox) works for that purpose.The last bit of disappointment is the ethernet port.  It would be nice if this port had some real use.  However, it serves one purpose and that is to use the enclosure as a Wifi hot spot.  You connect the ethernet port to whatever Internet access you have, say in your hotel room when traveling, and you now have a hotspot.  Since I already use my iPhone as a hot spot when I travel, primarily to avoid the ridiculous rates hotels charge, I don't see the purpose.  But my disappointment is that an ethernet connection should be faster than the USB 3.0 one for transferring files.  However, the ethernet port can't be used for transferring files.  The drive does not operate as a NAS drive while connected this way.  This isn't really surprising considering the price.One comment on the provided Mac app.  When I first installed the app on my Macbook Pro, the app would not connect to the drive.  After some major frustration I discovered the problem (not documented) was that my Macbook Pro was ethernet attached to my home network, and I could not have both that connection and the Macally drive connected via WiFi at the same time.  Disconnecting the ethernet cable from my laptop solved this problem.  Since I use the drive for my i-devices this isn't a problem for me.

Display quality is sharp and colors are vivid.  It has the full Windows 8.1 operating system, not Windows RT, which means you can load regular Windows software just like a regulars Windows 8.1 desktop or laptop computer.  It boots up quickly, apps and programs load very fast.  With an OTG cable, you can connect USB devices such as a thumb drive or wireless mouse.  You can also connect larger peripherals as well such as as an external hard driver or DVD player (though you will probably need a powered USB hub for the large devices such as these, as the tablet's internal power isn't sufficient.).  Microsoft Office Student and Teacher edition is included at no extra cost, making this a great little computer that you can actually do real work with while on the go.That's the good.  Now for the bad.  Putting it simply, many of the Windows 8 apps are just plain terrible, lacking in key features.  Take the Kindle app for Windows 8, for example.  I can only download my Kindle books, not Kindle periodicals or magazines.  C'mon, Amazon, you can do better than that.  My whole purpose for having a Kindle app on a tablet is so that I can read magazines in color and look a the pictures i.e. have a more traditional magazine reading experience.  I don't read books on my Kindle app.  I have my dedicated Kindle e-reader for that purpose.  I can download magazines to my Android tablet as well as my Ipod touch.  Other apps, such as the Fox News app for Windows 8, look like they were just thrown together as an afterthought.  When I open a video in Fox News, it causes Internet explorer to boot up side by size, cutting the screen size of the app in half, presenting a disjointed experience.  What's up with that? I find myself ignoring the app all together and just accessing the Fox News web site.  I could go on.  So, my beef is not with the tablet, or Windows 8 per se, but with the writers of the apps for this platform.

I have a prehistoric 7-8 year old Dell Dimension E510 desktop that is super slow. So, I made the decision to buy a laptop under $400 yet still faster than my desktop.I set my eyes on this laptop from a local electronics store. I compared specs, from the size and weight, to the nitty features like the number of USBs. And so, here I have it.Let's start off with the design.The design of this notebook is, well, plastic. However, it isn't cheap plastic. The materials used are actually pretty good for its price point. The notebook is nice and rounded around the corners and the thickness of this notebook is about one inch. Now, most notebooks for this price point would be much thicker...Around 1.3in-1.4in, but Dell managed to squeeze everything in 1 inch. This is pretty darn good considering the tools this notebook provides. On the left side of the computer you have a headphone/microphone jack, 3 USB (2 USB 3.0) (1 USB 2.0), Ethernet, HDMI cable, and a power outlet. On the left side you have the optical drive and one more USB port (2.0). So the total amount of USBs this notebook has is 4. 4 USB ports, 2 of which are 3.0. USB 3.0 is relatively new for the market, and this allows much quicker transfer speeds compared to the 2.0s. However, most computers at this price point do not have USB 3.0s, or if they do, it would only be one or two. But keep in mind that this notebook has 4 USB ports. And at this price point, most if not all computers only have about 2 or 3. The optical drive is also a neat feature. For a 1 inch laptop that has an optical drive is pretty impressive considering the price. Most notebooks that are 1 inch or less usually skip the optical drive. Now, the bad thing about the thinness of this notebook is that it does not have a VGA port. You might need a HDMI to VGA port adapter for that. However, considering VGA's thickness and the thinness of notebooks that are coming out each year, VGA is bound to be obsolete due to the benefits of HDMI.On the interior, the notebook has a LARGE track pad. And this is good especially when it is running on windows 8 (I'll get to that later).Below the track pad, there are two left and right buttons. These buttons feel and sound cheap but that is not to be unexpected. When running, the track pad get quite warm. You really can't fault the computer for this because this is a one inch notebook. Since the ram sticks are essentially below the track pad, prepare yourself to have warm fingers. The keyboard is an island style keyboard that are evenly spaced. The key travel is okay. After writing a 5-6 page essay. It's also got a 10 key number pad. However, I do wish that number lock had a tiny light located on the button like the caps lock does. As I'm typing, I sometimes reach over to the number lock while attempting to backspace. One minor complaint is keyboard flex towards the F8-F10 keys, not a big deal since these keys aren't often used. Also, like other reviewer have mentioned before. This computer has a sharp lip. As you are typing, the sharp lip is somewhat irritating. Doesn't hurt to take out a fine grit sand paper is smooth out that lip.Lastly, the spacing between the keys have a glossy finish. I notice that this attracts dust and requires occasional cleaning.As for the hardware,You get 500gb of storage but only 456gb of that storage is usable (the non-usable storage has to be used for the operating system. It runs on 4gb of ram and although it is sufficient, you may want to upgrade to 6 or 8 gigs of ram as you load more programs. But if you're an average web browser, 4 gigs is good enough. To just give you a idea at idle, it is using about 46% of the computers ram. The computer has one extra slot. [edit] The computer will accept 16gb of ram storage. I would suggest throwing in another 4gb as it will give you extra performance due to the dual channel configuration. After removing all the bloatware and Windows finally settled in after dozens of updates this notebook starts up well under a minute. Considering a startup to be when the computer starts to idle.-by the way, uninstall the additional trial anti-virus. Windows 8 already has Defender and so that antivirus will just eat up your resources, I think it comes with Kaspersky or McAfee-The operating system,Now, I'm coming from Windows XP and 7, to be honest...Windows 8 is actually pretty cool. However, if you're an old geezer who likes the traditional interface, Win 8 probably wouldn't be a great option. Anyway, the big benefit of this laptop that allows you to enjoy Windows 8 without the use of a touch screen is the large track pad. This Dell has a 4 and 1/2 inch track pad and using multi gestures features makes it extremely easy.Of course, you can always disable the Windows 8 start up and have it behave like Windows 7. (Look up Windows 8 RetroUI) Other than that, the OS would definitely benefit with a touch screen but without it the system is still enjoyable.Battery life,On a full charge, I get around three to four hours of regular internet browsing.Now for the thinness of this laptop, this computer has a 4 cell battery vs the 6 cell that are in most laptops. Under intense radio loading such as streaming, it will drop to 2 hours...Maybe 3. Keep in mind; you do not want to torture your batteries. The lithium ion batteries used in modern laptops do not like to be charged and discharged abruptly as this will diminish battery life. But, I'm willing to sacrifice 2 cells for a thinner and lighter laptop than have a big and heavy 6 cell.Screen:15.6 inches, 1366x768 glossy.Screen resolution isn't an issue here since most laptops--especially at this price point, have this type of resolution. The problem I commonly have is the viewing angles. This Dell uses a TNF panel, which is offers a distortion of colors when it isn't at the right angle.As for the glossy finish, well, it sucks. It still amazes me why computer corporations still use a glossy finish. The glossy finish and the bad viewing angles makes it somewhat of an unpleasant experience.The WLED screen is bright but the colors could use more saturation.Webcam:It is equipped with a 1 megapixel camera.After using Skype, the picture quality is pretty good.If I compared it with my other Lenovo G560 which has a 0.3 megapixel camera, the difference is like light and day.ProcessorOkay, so it doesn't have TurboBoost or 4-way processing.I have using an Intel Pentium Processor on a Lenovo notebook on Windows 7 and it's pretty good. It gets through most tasks however you must know your limitations.Considering the computers size, weight, and battery configuration, the processor is clocked at 1.9ghz on dual core. I have previously used a Pentium 4 @ 3GHz (a single core processor) and this laptop is significantly faster considering the dual core. Out of box, it scored a 4.7 on the Windows Experience Index. After everything got settled in with the way I liked it, it dropped to a 4.6. Using my way of testing the processor speed, I calculated Pi (Using SuperPi) to one million digits and it did it in 21 seconds. Not bad considering my Dell Desktop does it in 43 seconds... It handles HD streaming off YouTube without problems however when you stream in 720p you CPU usage hovers around 35-60%. Yet, doesn't give you a lot of room of other tasks.Gaming? Well, not much. Don't expect to play WoW or Crisis. It should handle basic games.This processor is equipped with Intel HD Ivy Bridge graphics. Very similar to Intel HD 2000.I was able to play RuneScape on the highest screen settings (other than full screen) with the use of their client rather than the browser. The CPU usage hovers around 80-90%. Game play was still smooth considering it is a 3D game. However, with 80-90% usage, again, does not leave much room for other tasks.Upgrades:The only upgrades you can do to this laptop is RAM and hard drive. The stock hard drive runs at 5400rpm and although it is pretty quick, a solid state would be pointless because you'd be most likely dissatisfied with SSD's price and storage (until they get cheaper). If 500gb is too little, a 7200 rpm hard drive won't hurt.The computer comes with 4gb of ram. Although this is sufficient for basic tasks, it isn't configured as dual channel. Filling that extra DIMM slot will give you better memory storage as well as graphics performance. So why not do it?The CPU/Processor--unfortunately, cannot be upgraded. This is because it is a Ultra Low Voltage Processor (ULV) that is soldered onto the motherboard. This is a big down side since later down the road, you can't upgrade to a used processor at a significantly low price.It's portable, offers a large track pad, good keys, and is loaded with 4 USBs and an optical drive @ just one inch. Overall, this is a great laptop but I wouldn't consider this to be a everyday user. (I use it as a primary since I'm coming from a prehistoric computers, in fact this computer is twice as fast than my old desktop) The processor is the caveat. If you have the option, go for their higher end \"i Series\" of Intel Core Processors.-UPDATE-I reran the Windows Experience Index (WEI) and it jumped from a 4.6 to a 5.1. I guess Windows obtained a better score after removing bloatware and installing the latest drivers. Additionally, a dual channel RAM configuration will allow a slight bump in graphics performance.So here are the subscores that the WEI came up with:Processor: 5.9Memory (RAM): 7.7 &lt;-- I upgraded to 8gbGraphics: 4.6 to 5.1 &lt;-- Graphics performance increases due to a 8gb dual channel configuration, Base score determined by lowest subscore.Gaming graphics: 6.2Primary hard disk: 5.9The WEI scores are based on a scale of 1.0-9.9-Update 2-This would probably fall under build quality. Earlier today I found a missing screw lying on my desk when plugging the notebook for charging. It turns out that this screw was one of the missing screws that was attached to the bottom of the notebook. I was thinking, \"lucky me, good thing I didn't lose it\". So I screwed it back and, and while I was at it I went ahead and checked the rest of the screws. It turns out that all of the screws were not secured tightly (about 2-3 rotations loose). Although they had blue loctite on them, it was not firmly screwed on. Keep in mind, I did not touch any of these screws other than the RAM slot panels which were already secured. I don't know if it just my computer or an entire batch, but a simple production step like secured screws worries me.I would drop a star off my rating (3 stars), but I'm relatively satisfied with my purchase.-Update 3-Running Windows 8.1! The transition was almost flawless except that there was a program I had to uninstall (w/ a little difficulty).Windows 8.1 makes the non-touch situation seem more enjoyable.Couple of complaints is that the two finger tap stopped functioning even after installing the latest drivers designed specifically for 8.1. Sleep functions seems to be a hit and miss as well. Windows 8 slept fine, but 8.1 won't sleep when the computer idles. While searching around the internet, this seems to be a fault by Microsoft and not Dell.If you can live through those gripes, upgrade to 8.1.-Update 4-Now running Windows 8.1 Update 1 (8.1.1). Microsoft added several features that makes Win8 more barable with a keyboard and mouse.

I recently discovered this is a replaceable part and was so happy to put my headphones back to work.I received these in 2 days, and quickly got to fitting them. There is an insulative foam on the plastic ring that makes it too fat to fit under the clips on the headphone chassis. No problem. I removed the thickness and the plastic ring left behind was almost exactly the same thickness as the originals. After making this modification, I lined up the connection, and there was about 1/8&#34; of hard plastic sticking out past the edge of the headphone chassis.Basically, you can get 3/4 of the perimeter clipped in, as the spare material piles up and will not go into place. I need to remove a ring of plastic from around the entire circumference of the replacement pads. I have not been able to do it yet, but i need to take a fingernail clippers and probably a small file and remove this material from the entire earpads.I am assuming that i can hack these and make them work, but not without at least one hour of work. The fitment is completely wrong, and that makes this bargain much more hassle that it is worth. If you are going to produce cheap knockoffs to capitalize on the replacement parts market, at least trace the original better. I expect that this pad was made for some other bose headphones with a bit different dimensions. For me to have to modify the thickness as well as the circumference is just too far from the original.Most likely, they sold me something designed for the QC line or some other bose headphones... though i ordered the TP-1 unit and it was packaged and labled as the TP-1 unit.

I've also tried two HomeWorx units and they share the same faults and attributes. I returned the Viewtv unit and may do the same with the HomeWorx units.

Now, other features that are hard to deal with: A 24 hour clock; Recording names are by date and time only, not the show's name; Odd, remote function names that make for awkward use.

I had concerns about the sound quality of most of the items on the market but have always valued Sony products so I thought I would give these a shot.To my delight, they provide outstanding reproduction.  The sound is crisp, clear and rich.  What we fail to realize is that today's TV and DVD content is loaded with detailed sound.  Speakers, no matter how good, are dissipating the sound throughout the room.  Detail is inevitably missed.  As with music, headphones make a huge difference for TV and video.  These are very comfortable to wear.  The setup took about 30 seconds and the charge seems to last plenty long.Even though these are discontinued and an older model, they are great and I urge anyone to order them without delay, if, and it is a big if,  your receiver, cable box, dvr or other source has a digital optical audio output.  These headphones have only one digital setup option:  optical cable.  Most new receivers no longer have an optical audio output.  My great 2 year old Denon receiver didn't.I couldn't even find a new higher end A/V receiver to buy that had an optical audio output.  I feared that I was going to have to set the phones up using analog connections which I really did not want to do.Then I had an inspiration to look at the back of my TIVO Premiere XL.  Sure enough, it had an optical output.  The Sony transmitter connected immediately and the sound was perfect.  Better still, the Sony headphones set up this way operate independently of theTV audio simultaneously coming out of my Denon receiver.  The volume of each can be controlled independently and there is no delay between the two audio tracks.  Perfect!Sony's new model of this item comes with an HDMI connection making life much easier.  However, those phones are more that $400 even on Amazon.  I usually spare no expense but that number gave me some pause as I had no idea what the sound quality would be using those phones.

This is one of those times and that's the beauty of it. I'm willing to pay for all those engineering hours that went into making a product that just works.Why only 4 stars? Sirius does drop out every now and then. And I do wish Sonos was clearer about how the Connect fits into the picture. I would have bought this a lot earlier and saved myself a lot of time playing around with other solutions.There seems to be a lot of marketing and instructions regarding the Sonos Play devices, but not much about this one. For example, I had thought using Sonos would require me to ditch my current audio system and move completely to their speakers because pretty much every solution they showed had a few of those Sonos speakers sprinkled in. Also, I wish they had it in black so that it blended in better with my other audio equipment.I had a few questions about the system and my local Best Buy guys couldn't answer them. I could tell they were just making up stuff and hoping I wouldn't ask more questions. For example, they were convinced I needed a bridge (wrong) and that the Connect was basically a router and that I would need a computer on at all times in order to make this work (also wrong).So, I emailed Sonos directly (they have their email listed on the Support section of their website). Within a few hours I had the answers I needed to make my decision. That's good customer service right there- I wasn't yet a customer, and yet they were very prompt about helping me make the right choices. Sonos didn't try to sell me things I didn't need. Very impressive.My current setup:-Pioneer Elite SC-75 receiver-Martin Logan EM-ESL speakers-Dynamo 700 sub-MyCloud (all my music files are on the MyCloud) connected via Ethernet cable directly to the router-Sonos Connect (without the amp feature because I use wired speakers to my Pioneer receiver)-I do not have any other Sonos components (no Bridge, no Sonos speakers, just the Connect only)-I do not leave a computer running to work with this system-My wireless router is right by the Sonos: the Connect is connected directly to the router by Ethernet cableThe questions I had were (paraphrased):Question:If I use my iPad to control the Connect music lists (kick off a playlist, play Sirius, etc.) does the iPad need to remain on if no music files are being used from it.Answer: All of the programming stays on the Connect itself. You can basically turn off the iPad completely and the Connect will work just fine once you've started your music. You'll need to make sure if you are playing music files that the source for those files is accessible. So, if you do have your music on your iPad or computer, that needs to stay on so the Connect can access the files and play them.Question: I really like my DAC on the Pioneer Elite SC-75 and want to use it instead of the DAC in the Connect. How do I do that?Answer: If you use a digital optical cable out from the Connect and into the Pioneer, the signal remains digital and the DAC on the Pioneer will do the conversion.  If you use the RCA connectors out of the Connect and into the Pioneer, the signal is converted from digital to analog by the Connect DAC. The RCA cable was included. If you want to use digital optical, you'll need to buy one.Question: Do I need to buy a bridge?Answer: No. You can connect your Connect by using an Ethernet cable right to the router.As long as your controller software (in my case, the iPad) can communicate with the same network that the Connect is on, you're fine. You only need the bridge if you cannot connect your Connect directly to the router or if you need to communicate to other Sonos components (like Sonos speakers) that are not connected to the router via Ethernet. The controller (in my case, iPad) never communicates using the wireless connection that is used between the Bridge and the Sonos components. It just goes across the regular wireless that you have going on in your house. For me, I have the Connect plugged directly into my NightHawk wireless router and that's the same router that serves the wireless connection for my iPad. Works perfectly. And they do include the Ethernet cable right in the box.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "It just works!", "unixReviewTime": 1389484800, "reviewTime": "01 12, 2014"}

For this use case, I'm calling the Sony AS100 the best action camera on the market because the image quality is great and the image stabilization works well. This is the only action camera that I have seen with built-in image stabilization and that feature makes a huge difference when bicycling. Even when bicycling on good quality roads, there are enough bumps to make the video unpleasant to watch without image stabilization. The in-camera image stabilization works great for me, giving me much better results than the Adobe Premier stabilization filter, which take forever to run in addition to producing unsatisfactory results.I have also used Sony's previous action camera, the AS30. That model also has image stabilization and generally works OK, but has enough quirks to make the total experience less than idea. Most importantly, the AS100 has noticeably improved image quality, with clearer images as well as better color and contrast. Some other improvements that I immediately noticed:1. With the AS30, the only way to tell if the camera was shooting is to look at the small LCD screen on the side of the camera, which is hard to do when you are riding your bicycle. The AS100 now has red LEDs on the top and back of the camera to easily tell your if the camera is shooting. This is a huge improvement for me. With the AS30, I missed many shots because I thought the camera was on when it was not.2. With the AS30, you have to put the camera in the clunky underwater case before attaching it to your bicycle or helmet. With the helmet mount, this can be uncomfortable because of the weight of the case. The AS100 now includes a lightweight, but still secure, holder for use with all mounts.3. In addition to reducing weight and bulk, this holder also lets you replace the camera battery without removing the camera from the case. You can also access the USB port (for downloading video and/or recharging) without removing the holder. Without the case, the camera is less protected, but that's not a big deal for my uses (the camera will probably become obsolete before I crash with it).4. Possibly because I'm not longer using the waterproof case all the time, the AS100 camera lens seems to pick up much less glare than the AS30. With the AS30, shooting in the direction of the sun usually produced worthless videos because of glare. This no longer seems to be a problem with the AS100, at least so far.5. The AS30 already had great audio (for an action camera), but the AS100 is noticeably better. I notice much less wind noise with the Sony cameras than with other brands. The AS100 seems clearer to me with with regard to other audio input like conversations and bicycle mechanical sounds.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "best action camera if you want to mount on a bicycle handlebar", "unixReviewTime": 1398902400, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2014"}

The screen is bright, with pleasant colors and no glare thanks to matte finish. The windshield mount is compact and easy to use. I like that you can download interfaces and voices in many different languages. The display showing speed limit next to my current speed is really handy. Once it's done calculating the route (which can take a while) It does a good job of navigation. That said, I've been spoiled by Google's incredibly powerful navigation app on my phone, and this Garmin is just not in the same league. It can be fussy with address entry, and sometimes fails to find the destination even if I spell it fully. With Google app I can enter a partial address and it will figure out the rest, even correcting my typos. When I deviate from the suggested route, this Garmin seems to take too long to notice and re-calculate. Of course Google navigation requires an internet connection to do its tricks, so if I plan to travel where network coverage is poor, Garmin will be the tool of choice. But if you mostly drive in populated areas, Google navigation is far superior.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice unit, with some flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1391126400, "reviewTime": "01 31, 2014"}
