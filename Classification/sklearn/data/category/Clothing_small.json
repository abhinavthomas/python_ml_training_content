Everything is padded, so I don't wind up feeling like my circulation is being cut off, nor do I take it off and have bra strap impressions on my shoulders.For three smaller hooks, I was impressed with how well the elastic seems to hold up.  I also think the cups look natural and hold the breasts in a natural, but perky enough position.  Other than the stupid bow (why must they put bows on bras), the material isn't clingy and doesn't pull on fabric or crinkle it.The only thing I wish was different is that the under &#34;wire&#34; portion was thicker.  The size fits me well, but because the under-band makes this weird little curve upwards on your ribcage, it sacrifices support in that area- so the bra sometimes ends up leaving a gap in the bottom middle of my breasts that I find unsupportive and uncomfortable.  It may have been done just for style, but I wish it just went straight across and didn't curve.For the price, I'll be buying more, though.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best bra so far", "unixReviewTime": 1399334400, "reviewTime": "05 6, 2014"}

{"reviewerID": "A7YMD8MSOBO1I", "asin": "B00E1O2Q9Y", "reviewerName": "Sharon Beverly", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "First Impressions:* This is a decent looking piece of luggage that rolls on inline wheels.*  Its pull-up/push/down handle rises and lowers easily, locking into just one height.  (At 5' 4\" I find it comfortable for me.) Those with larger hands will like the T-bar handle, as it's comfortably large enough to grasp.  The handle's frame is located on the outside of the bag, leaving it with bulges and an uneven surface (not a negative, just an observation).*  It has a very convenient zip pocket at the top.  It could hold travel documents for easy access, a bottle of water, your e-reader, too.* Outer zip pockets make it possible to access the inside of the suitcase without having to completely unzip it in half.* There are handles on all four sides, making it easy to lift/store.* Being black and without distinct colors/marks leaves this suitcase virtually indistinguishable from others.  It will be important to add a unique address tag to quickly identify it as yours.  (This review also applies to the 'Carbon Full Cycle Twill' bags.  In this instance, the bags have a soft-gray fabric look with red top stitching.)Upon Further Inspection:* This suitcase is made with a sturdy frame.* Its outer `skin' is comprised of a durable-looking nylon and inner compartment's lining is a plastic-feeling material, with mesh pockets.  (My thoughts are that the lining will eventually dry out and crack.)* This bag is well designed.  The mesh should be able to prevent the slipping and wrinkles that occur in a case that isn't fully packed.  These inner compartments also make it easier to find items without digging through the entire bag.* The outer ridges (for the T-handle) on the bag are also two big bumps within the suitcase.  If you want a completely flat inner surface, this will not give it to you.* The places where the wheels are connected to the handle's axle are joined by (surprisingly) sloppy looking plastic caulking.* If you are packing the bag on a bed, it will not roll.  However, if you are using a bench or other smooth surface, it will roll, as the inline skates cannot be tipped to the side.  If using a fold-out luggage rack with straps, it should be fine, provided the wheels can hang over the side of the rack.* The zippers on this luggage appear to be durable, but do not smoothly move along their tracks.  (You may want to rub wax candle on one of the tracks to see if it improves the glide.)Last Thoughts:* This is a mid-range price point for a piece of luggage.  Its durability remains to be seen.*  Infrequent travelers may want to select a less expensive bag, while those who travel frequently may opt for a suitcase with these features:  360-degree wheels, better quality lining, handles with two adjustable heights, piggy-backing capability (a strap allows you to attach multiple bags together, but lets you wheel just one).* While this is proclaimed to be a light-weight bag, note that if weight issues are a concern, there are lighter bags on the market.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Has Its Good and Less Desirable Features", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400, "reviewTime": "06 25, 2014"}

Both the insole and seat fit my heel perfectly, and the outer material looks and smells like leather.Time will tell with respect to how long these will last, but as of now I am not only thrilled with the purchase, but still in disbelief that I got them for such a low price.

I wore them around the house for a little while but found them rubbing my left foot just below the ankle, and they had TOO MUCH support for the metatarsal area. Way too stiff with a very hard insole. My feet were aching badly. It felt like I'd been wearing those Dr. School's wooden clog/sandals we all used to wear in the 1970s!!I swapped out the insole with a gel insole to get some cushioning, and that didn't help. Then I ordered the PowerStep inserts that I have used in less supportive sneakers, and they did not work at all. Four different insoles and my feet ached every time.If you don't have problem feet, these may be fine for you, but if you need firm but gentle support, I wouldn't recommend them.

I'm plus sized and very curvy and in the 10 years I've been wearing scrubs I never liked the fit of any of them. These flexibles are my new best friend! They are the first tops I've had that have a cute feminine look, are comfortable, move with me, don't ride up when I sit down, smoothly cover my large bust without either looking like I'm wearing a tent or so tight that I feel I look unprofessional. Nothing worse than a top that's too tight or shows cleavage when you're working with pediatrics or geriatric men!! The side panels colors blend in with the material and are soft and smooth making the top feel a lot more like a regular shirt than a scrub. The sleeves are a good size & cut they don't limit your reach like other scrubs do. The only thing I don't love about this style is the little clip buttons on the pockets-- I don't think shirt pockets need to close and the little flap gets in the way of pulling things in and out of your pockets quickly. Also the length could stand to be a little longer but I'm 5'11&#34; so I expect the regular sizes to hit me about an inch shy of where I'd prefer, fortunately this top is stretchy so it can be pulled down slightly for added length.

Ended up wearing it with capri-length pants on a very, very hot day spending a lot of time hiking around outside, and I'm very happy with the way the shirt performed.  The fabric on it is thick; you will not see the outline of a bra through it, and there's no worry of it being sheer (at least not in the avocado color).  The avocado color itself is a pretty light green; not neon-bright, but not boring either. The neckline is pretty much t-shirt high, but there's the little v that gives the neck a little breathing room, which is really nice without being revealing.  The sleeves are standard t-shirt length; longer than a cap sleeve, shorter than a man's t-shirt.  They completely cover the shoulder and the top of the arm.  I'd say the sizing runs a little big; I normally wear a medium in t-shirts because I like a little space, but I bought a small in this one and I'm glad I did.  It was plenty long-enough (shorter than tunic length, it's not a shirt I'd pair with leggings, but longer than a standard tee shirt, very close to what's shown on the model) and roomier than any small I've ever really worn, although it did still maintain a nice shape.Being the fabric was so thick, I was worried I'd overheat, but I had no choice but to give it a shot. And surprisingly, I was no hotter than I'd have been in most of my tank tops.  The fabric breathed really well, didn't show sweat too glaringly, and generally was great.  I was comfortable all day, as comfortable as one can be in extreme heat and humidity anyway.  I'm not sure it'll become a wardrobe staple, since it's a little older-looking than I normally tend to go, but I'm going to try to find a way to fit it into heavier rotation, since it's so comfortable.

I have always wanted a pair of thigh high slouchy boots, but they are usually outrageously priced in stores and on certain websites. I fell in love with the picture and desctription and especially, the price. After reading other customer reviews, I had mixed feelings. A lot of reviewers loved them, but there were quite a few that made mention of the boots being cheaply made. Because of the price, I took a chance and ordered them anyways. They arrived within a few days, and when I pulled them out of the box, I was not disappointed. The boots are absolutely adorable. I had a little issue getting them on, because there is no zipper, but they fit well. Be warned, they run small. I usually wear a 9 or a 10, depending on how they are made, but I ordered an 11 just in case. Im glad I did. These boots wouldn't have fit me if I hadnt ordered a size up. They are by far the most comfortable pair of shoes I own. I took away one star, because the boots do feel a little cheaply made, and I honestly don't expect more than a few months of wear out of them. The souls are thin, and the inside material of the boots feels like nothing more than some kind of cheap foamy material. But for the price, you honestly cant beat them.

I have a huge running shoe collection because my body is apparently very picky with shoes. Who knew.Firstly this shoe is ugly in the gray/teal. It looks like something my grandmother would wear. When you put it on it is immediately apparent that this is a LOT of shoe. It feels &#34;big&#34; and not size wise - rather it just feels kind of clunky. It's not heavy - in fact it is very light, but the way it is designed it comes up very high all around and so it makes it feel less like a running shoe and more like a work shoe. It is more similar to my hiking shoes than to my running shoes. I've had several people remark how not attractive it is - so I always have this &#34;yeah I'll wear it but it's so ugly feeling&#34; which doesn't work well for me. Now I don't go for only attractive shoes - but I just find these so unattractive it's hard not to think about what I've got on my feet. Yes I'm a little shallow - but these really are on the other side of ugly.As for comfort and running these are great. They are very comfortable and very supportive. You can absolutely feel the cushion - no way to mistake it. They do feel somewhat like a Hoka and they have the same issue as Hoka's for me and that is stability. I feel like my feet are not stable in them - like there is too much shift and I'm on top of a platform and could fall off almost. No I do not need stability shoes (I'm a neutral runner with a high arch and no pronation issues). I feel like I'm always conscious of being slightly unstable so it affects my gait. Since they also feel so &#34;much&#34; for my feet this makes me feel like I'm running more carefully and when I should just be able to run freely I keep coming back to how they feel on my feet. They are &#34;always&#34; there - absolutely no disappearing for me.The 3 star rating is a compromise. I use these for recovery runs in my neighborhood - around 3-7 miles. They provide enough cushion so my feet/legs are not tired at all when I'm finished which is perfect for this type of run. However they are just too much shoe (and too ugly) and not quite stable enough to use for any form of racing. Since I run races that are 10K-Half Marathon's these shoes would provide the cushion I need but with the issues I just don't feel comfortable using them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Recovery runs are good - but this is a LOT of shoe (and it's ugly - Boo!)", "unixReviewTime": 1400630400, "reviewTime": "05 21, 2014"}

That's a definite plus for me. I'm not fanatical about the subject, but I do prefer to buy domestic items if possible. In my experience, it's very unusual to find any article of clothing or footwear that's not made overseas.\"Other than that, these shoes seem very well made of quality materials. They're true to size in both length and width. I normally wear a 6.5 or 7, and this size 7 fits perfectly as long as I wear relatively thick socks. The sides and top easily spread out very wide, so they're exceptionally easy to put on. I'd rate the built-in arch support as medium--not too little, not too much. It's just right for me.\"I'm not really wild about the shiny silver finish on much of the material; I can't help but think it won't hold up well over time. The subdued purple and orange accents are subtle and attractive. I would prefer that the sides of the sole be gray rather than stark white, which I think will get dirty and scuffed very quickly, but that's not a big issue. The sole itself is flat and deeply textured, so grip is excellent--although I haven't yet tested them on a wet surface.\"These shoes fit me better than any others that I've owned in recent memory. With their pleasing design, excellent materials, perfect fit and sturdy construction, I expect them to provide me with many years of use. If you're looking for a good pair of shoes and want to \"buy American,\" you should definitely consider these.\"", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Finally, a Pair of Shoes that Fits!", "unixReviewTime": 1404259200, "reviewTime": "07 2, 2014"}

In particular, I found that the fit of this dress tends to run for a very thin, not too busty body frame. I struggled reading the reviews to decide which size would be appropriate for me to buy, and I decided to go with the Small size 4/6 (I am usually like a 3) and it does fit as I would like. One thing I found odd is that the black banding pattern around the waist does not appear as close together as it does in this photo (it is a notable and significant black band clearly distinct from the waist area), and that the white bust portion definitely works better for a slightly flatter chested girl (and I am just a 34 C). I weigh 115 and am 5'5&#34; and it looks like I have a larger stomach by the way these weird black half circle bands stretch above the belly and down almost on top of the butt on the back side. I fixed this issue by taking a blue sash belt and tying it high up under the best to make a bow/floating sash belt, to distract the eye from some of this awkwardness.

I ordered the 39 (I usually wear an 8 to 8 1/2) and it was fine width-wise and length-wise as well, maybe a bit long but I have really short toes compared to where my arches hit so I'm calling it good) but it hurt the tops of my feet right where the laces start (by the toes)  The shoes have hard bottoms so they don't actually bend like you would expect a tennis shoe to bend.  They sort of &#34;roll.&#34;  They also make a strange sort of &#34;clickety clack&#34; noise on the hard floor which is disconcerting when I'm looking at what appears to be a sneaker. The laces tighten nicely but my heel still slips quite a bit.  I'm not sure how much they will stretch out with wear and if I can get used to the uncomfortable area above the laces. Since they don't actually bend, I'm not sure how much that will affect the comfort.  I will change socks to thicker ones with more cushion and wear them around the house to see if I can get used to them and get the heel to stop slipping.  If I can't, I'll be sending them back.

I ordered all of these and just finished trying them on.  I usually need a large shirt (e.g. Banana Republic 100% Pima cotton T-shirt) as my shoulders are fairly wide, but I am not a big guy - 5'8&#34; 150#.  I am kind of a big medium or a small large, depending.  Usually, as I said, I buy a large shirt.Cressi is the cheapest.  Don't ask me why but the color configuration is exactly the same as the O'Neill, so I thought they might actually be the same garment, different labels - but I was wrong.  This is 80% polyester, 20% elastane.  It says SPF of 40.  For me, the XL was the one that fit.  Just putting the L over my head I knew it wouldn't fit.  It is the shortest of the three brands, which may be good, as who wants a lot of material bunching up around your hips - but it will probably be too short for taller guys.  The material feels kind of thick and a bit inflexible.  Not super soft.  May last longer though.O'Neill medium priced.  89% polyester, 11% elastane.  This has a softer hand than the Cressi and is longer too.  For me the L was slightly big, but the M was too small.  I would go with the L.  SPF is rated at 50.  The length feels right for the size.  The sewing around the neck (on the inside) feels a bit scratch, not sure how that would play out in actual use.Body Glove.  Slightly more expense.  85% polyester, 15% Spandex.  SPF of 50.  A nice soft hand - the softest of the three.  The length feels appropriate for the size.  I only bought an XL and could wear it just fine.  I would expect an L would be a bit too tight.  My favorite.Body Glove is the brand I am replacing, one that is thicker and heavier than these three, 88% Nylon, 12% Spandex.  It lasted for years of use, but is no longer available in a variety of sizes.

Not only is Sony much cheaper and suits me better, but as of April, 2014, you can now change the wallpaper, similar to Galaxy 2 watches.  Overall I think this smartwatch is better suitable for me than Galaxy 2 and here is why:Battery lasts longer:  Two plus days of moderate use and it still keeps on ticking.  Charging it everyday would make it feel like another device rather than a watch.  I wasn't a fan of wearing a watch, but I am now.Charging:  To charge this, simply connect it to any USB-powered outlet or computer.  Galaxy 2 offers a complicated dongle and because I'll have to charge it more often, it would become a hassle.Less is more:  I realize that with Galaxy 2 I can take pictures and use it as a speakerphone, but do I need that?  First off, taking a picture with your watch will make you look downright creepy at times and I'm sure with time, more public places will notice and restrict the use of it(like gym.)  While talking through a watch might be handy at some point, do I really need to look like a Power Ranger on a street?Thinner:  Sony is thinner by design and as I've mentioned before, it was important for me to have a swartwatch that resembles a more traditional discreet watch rather than a &#34;look at me I'm a futuristic device watch.&#34;Cheaper:  If you get the right deal, this watch can cost you almost two times less than Galaxy 2 and because I do not eat caviar for breakfast nor own a diamond-studded swimming pool, this is important to me as well.Please note that I am not putting Galaxy 2 down.  I'm a fan of both brands.  I own a Galaxy phone and a tablet, which is why I was so torn, but Sony2 suited my lifestyle better.

You can dress it up, dress it down very easy to throw on over a black assets (spanks) undershirt with black jeggings and wear a good pair of boots or heels, sandals whatever and look cute going out for whatever occasion! I ordered more colors!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "I LOVE this top!", "unixReviewTime": 1395446400, "reviewTime": "03 22, 2014"}

I was skeptical because they look so plastic in the picture (which they are).  I thought they might be hard and uncomfortable; however, most of the reviews were positive so I took the plunge.  I absolutely love them!  The first day I received them, I went for a long walk.  They were completely comfy the entire time and today (the next day), my feet feel great.  They seem extremely durable - great for all conditions - pool, rain, walking to lunch in the sun, whatever.  I wear between a 7.5 and an 8 depending on the shoe so I purchased these in an 8 and they fit perfectly.  My foot is not wide or narrow.  I'm not a huge fan of the emblem thing on the side - and these are certainly not high fashion - but I'm sooo glad I made the purchase.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very very comfortable flip flops!", "unixReviewTime": 1402012800, "reviewTime": "06 6, 2014"}
